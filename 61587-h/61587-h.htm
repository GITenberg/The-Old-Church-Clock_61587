<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>A <span class="GutSmall">BRIEF</span> history of the following
homely little tale may perhaps be not less interesting, and more
edifying, than the tale itself.&nbsp; It was written originally
for the pages of <i>The Christian Magazine</i>, (a cheap monthly
publication, intended for circulation especially in the
manufacturing districts,) which is under the management of a
young clerical friend, who deserves the highest praise for the
energy with which he commenced, and the zeal and judgment with
which he has hitherto conducted it.</p>
<p>Like many more important events, the following story, which
commenced almost in jest, has ended almost in earnest.&nbsp; It
was not at first proposed that it should extend beyond three or
four chapters; but having nearly by accident carried his hero (so
to style him) into the North for a birth-place, a train of
associations was awakened of which the author could not forego
the record.&nbsp; Though by birth and descent a native of
Lancashire, he had resided long <a name="pagevi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vi</span>enough in the region of the English
Lakes to become enamoured with its wild and romantic scenes, and
intimately acquainted with the manners and mode of thinking of
its inhabitants; and, among other charms of that sequestered
district, not the least grateful to his imagination was the
character of <span class="smcap">Robert Walker</span>, for so
long a period incumbent of one of the most retired and romantic
portions even of that primitive country.&nbsp; Nor was it merely
as an exemplary parish priest, (and well does Robert Walker
deserve the title of Priest of the Lakes, as that of Apostle of
the North has been assigned to Bernard Gilpin,) that the
character of this good man is to be regarded, but as one striking
instance out of many (if the history of our Parish Priesthood
<i>could</i> now be written) in which the true liturgical
teaching of the Church was strictly maintained in the lower ranks
of the ministry, when it had been either totally discontinued or
had withered down into a mere lifeless form, in the higher.&nbsp;
It cannot be denied that corruption began from
above,&mdash;secular patronage and loose foreign notions and
manners first influencing those in station and authority, and
then naturally descending downwards into the ranks of the Church;
thus gradually corrupting the whole mass to such an extent, that
the chastisements which she has since received from the whips <a
name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vii</span>and scorns
of dissent became as wholesome as it was deserved.&nbsp; Now, in
the author&rsquo;s mind, there was an apostolical succession of
duty as well as office in Robert Walker, which convinced
him,&mdash;and consoled him with the thought,&mdash;that there
was nothing in the Church system itself which necessarily led to
that deadness in herself and activity and success in those who
dissented from her, which it was too often his lot to witness
during the first days of his ministry. <a
name="citationvii"></a><a href="#footnotevii"
class="citation">[vii]</a>&nbsp; No doubt, hundreds of <a
name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>his
brethren can look back, each to his Robert Walker in his own
district, by whose light his <a name="pageix"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. ix</span>path was cheered when all else seemed
dark around him.</p>
<p>The history of Robert Walker, however, is calculated to teach
a much more important lesson than <a name="pagex"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. x</span>this; although it be one which seems
so obvious to <i>reason</i>, that it could hardly have been
expected that any example should be required, even to
<i>enforce</i> it.&nbsp; It appears quite evident, at the first
glance, that as Faith can only be illustrated, proved, and
confirmed by good works, so Doctrine can only be impressed,
ingrafted, and made practical by discipline.&nbsp; It is true
that it may be conveyed into the mind, and painted on the
imagination, by distinct and impressive oral teaching alone; but
it can only become useful and even intelligible to the great
masses of men, by their being required to show, by some outward
act of their own, that they understand its utility, and make a
personal application of the truths which it conveys.&nbsp; When
our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> Himself
combined&mdash;never to be separated&mdash;outward acts and
observances with inward graces in the two holy Sacraments of His
religion, He taught us, at once by precept and example, that even
the most solemn and mysterious doctrines of His Church can only
be properly impressed on the heart and understanding by the
observance of some corresponding and outward act, as at once a
sign of obedience, and a channel of further grace.&nbsp; This is
the system on which our Prayer Book is constructed.&nbsp; Are men
to pray?&mdash;it tells them when and how.&nbsp; Are they to
believe certain <i>facts</i> in their religion?&mdash;it <a
name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>impresses
them on the heart and memory by periodical commemorations.&nbsp;
Are they to believe certain <i>doctrines</i>?&mdash;it brings
these prominently forth at fixed times and seasons.&nbsp; And so
on.&nbsp; Doctrine and discipline, with the Church, go hand in
hand, like faith and practice, the result of both.&nbsp; Now all
this seems so <i>reasonable</i>, that it might hardly appear to
require the test of experience to give it further sanction; yet
to that test we may fairly appeal; and the author has, in his own
mind, been constantly in the habit of doing so by the cheering
history of Robert Walker.&nbsp; Let us first look at the opposite
side of the picture, in the illustrious instance of <span
class="smcap">Newton</span>, the pious, laborious, and eloquent
minister of <span class="smcap">Olney</span>.&nbsp; Here is a
favourable specimen of the system of spreading the Gospel by
instructing the mind, and sanctifying the feelings of the hearer,
principally by oral teaching, without laying much stress upon the
necessity for prescribed outward observances.&nbsp; Yet what is
the result?&nbsp; No one can read <span
class="smcap">Cowper&rsquo;s</span> beautiful letters with regard
to that place and time, and not be painfully convinced of the
evanescent nature of all impressions which are merely made by
individual teaching on individual minds, without some external
bond of union by which a religious society may be held together
when the hand that first combined it has been <a
name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xii</span>withdrawn;
and some supply of fuel to rouse and rekindle the slumbering
embers, when the first light has been extinguished or
removed.&nbsp; Thus, nearly all traces of the teaching of that
good man disappeared almost as soon as his warning voice had
ceased to sound in the ears of his at the time willing hearers.
<a name="citationxii"></a><a href="#footnotexii"
class="citation">[xii]</a>&nbsp; But how different has been the
<a name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>result
in the case of the liturgical teaching and Prayer-Book discipline
of the humble Robert Walker!&nbsp; Even in his native valleys,
not only a pious remembrance of his character, but a willing
obedience to his precepts, still lingers.&nbsp; But especially in
his descendants, numerous, and scattered, and often in humble
circumstances as they are found to be, it is there that we
find,&mdash;as we might most expect to find,&mdash;the impress of
his character, deeply, the author hopes, indelibly impressed; and
showing itself in a manner most edifying to the observer, and
most confirmatory of the far-seeing wisdom with which our own
Church&rsquo;s system of discipline has been constructed.&nbsp;
It has been the author&rsquo;s good fortune, at different periods
of his life, to see, or to hear of-various members of this
favoured family, in almost every variety of station <a
name="pagexiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>to which
one single race can well be supposed liable; but the result of
his observation has been always the same.&nbsp; Walker&rsquo;s
great-grandson, the Rev. Robert Bamford, Vicar of Bishopton, who
first brought this venerable patriarch into notice beyond the
boundaries of his native hills, by a sketch of his character in
the columns of the <i>Christian Remembrancer</i>, (though partial
attention had many years previously been drawn to him by some
letters in the <i>Annual Register</i>) was himself a clergyman of
the highest character and promise.&nbsp; One of Walker&rsquo;s
daughters, Mrs. Borrowdale, who became a resident of Liverpool,
retained to the last the habits of obedience to the Prayer Book
which she had been taught in youth, and attended the daily
service of St. Thomas&rsquo;s in that town, till it finally
expired for want of the rubrical number of worshippers.&nbsp;
But, by a singular coincidence, the author was brought into
contact with this family in a way still more interesting to
himself; and gladly would he wish to convey to his readers&rsquo;
mind that sympathy with his feelings, which is necessary to enter
fully into the moral of this little narrative.&nbsp; The author,
some years ago, was presented by a friend to a living, and found
there as curate one who had married the great-grand-daughter of
Robert Walker.&nbsp; Here generations had passed away between the
early stock <a name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xv</span>and the last shoot of the tree; yet the connexion
between the two was by no means dissevered.&nbsp; The tree might
still be known by its fruit!&nbsp; She was one&mdash;(we may
speak freely of the dead, as they then become the common property
of the Church)&mdash;she was one whom it was not possible to know
and not to love.&nbsp; With the liberal education which a town
residence affords, she yet retained much of the freshness of
manner and unaffected simplicity of address which belong to the
better-educated class of females in a country place, and which
win the heart more than the finest polish of artificial
manners.&nbsp; Her real anxiety for the comfort and pleasure of
others, and total forgetfulness of self, formed that highest
species of flattery which no one can resist; while her attention
to domestic duties, her care for the poor, and her punctual
observance of religious services, combined to render her all that
one wishes to find in that most important of all stations&mdash;a
curate&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; She was proud&mdash;in the best sense
of the word&mdash;of her descent from Robert Walker; and Robert
Walker would have been proud of her.&nbsp; She was so attached to
the place&mdash;and a less promising or more laborious post could
hardly be conceived&mdash;that she had often been heard to
declare that nothing should remove her from it, even should any
chance deprive them of the curacy.&nbsp; At length <a
name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvi</span>the author
resolved to resign the living; and among other reasons for doing
so, one (of which he has the least reason to be ashamed) was that
he might be instrumental in procuring the succession to it for
those who were so well worthy to hold it.&nbsp; But, alas! how
mysterious are the ways of Providence!&nbsp; She, who had looked
up to this event as the highest point of her earthly ambition,
was destined never to enjoy the object of her hopes.&nbsp; Within
a very few weeks after this resignation, she was taken off by the
immediate stroke of death, by a complaint of which she had long
entertained reasonable fears.&nbsp; Yet she died, as she had
lived, in the service of her Master and His Church.&nbsp; She was
found by her husband dead on the sofa, with the Prayer Book
beside her, open at the place where she had just been hearing her
only child, a boy of about eight years of age, read aloud to her,
according to her custom, the service for the day.&nbsp; Thus
departed a true descendant of Robert Walker!&nbsp; Thus the
author&rsquo;s leave-taking of his late flock was converted into
<i>her</i> funeral sermon.&nbsp; He need not add <i>what</i>
topics would naturally suggest themselves as appropriate to the
melancholy occasion!</p>
<p>The author has thus put the reader in possession of some of
the reasons why the character of Robert Walker should have been
one of especial interest <a name="pagexvii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xvii</span>to himself: and he has now only to
explain the artifice which has been employed, in order that the
public might have it before them in all its beauty.</p>
<p>It is well known to all the readers of <span
class="smcap">Wordsworth</span>, that in addition to the sketch
which he has drawn of this primitive pastor in his great poem of
the Excursion, he has, in his notes to his sonnets on the River
Duddon, given a prose history of his life, from materials
supplied by the family, in language of the utmost simplicity and
beauty.&nbsp; This little memoir is, of course, locked up from
the generality of readers in the somewhat costly volumes of Mr.
Wordsworth&rsquo;s works; and the author has often wished that it
were reprinted in a separate form, for general perusal, as a
great man&rsquo;s &ldquo;Records of a Good man&rsquo;s
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Happening then, as has already been said, to
place the birth of his hero in the North, the thought occurred to
him so far to attempt a sketch of the character of Robert Walker,
as to justify him, in his own eyes, in presenting to the Poet the
request (even now an unreasonable one) that he would permit his
own true history of the Patriarch to accompany this little
narrative into the world.&nbsp; With this request Mr. Wordsworth
has kindly complied; thus conferring on the author a favour in
addition to many others previously received; and affording to his
reader the comfortable assurance <a name="pagexviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xviii</span>that, in purchasing this otherwise
meagre production, he will at least receive, in the following
memoir alone, something well worth his money.</p>
<p>The author has only to add, that the little sketch, at the
conclusion of the tale, of the late Rev. Joshua Brooks, Chaplain
of the Collegiate Church, may probably look like a caricature to
all except those who knew him; and, (now that the publication is
no longer anonymous) that the two characters in the dialogue are
both alike imaginary.</p>

<h2><a name="pagexix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xix</span>[From Mr. Wordsworth&rsquo;s notes to his series of
sonnets on the river Duddon.]</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> reader who may have been
interested in the foregoing Sonnets, (which together may be
considered as a Poem,) will not be displeased to find in this
place a prose account of the Duddon, extracted from Green&rsquo;s
comprehensive <i>Guide to the Lakes</i>, lately published.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The road leading from Coniston to Broughton is over high
ground, and commands a view of the River Duddon; which, at high
water, is a grand sight, having the beautiful and fertile lands
of Lancashire and Cumberland stretching each way from its
margin.&nbsp; In this extensive view, the face of nature is
displayed in a wonderful variety of hill and dale; wooded grounds
and buildings; amongst the latter, Broughton Tower, seated on the
crown of a hill, rising elegantly from the valley, is an object
of extraordinary interest.&nbsp; Fertility on each side is
gradually diminished, and lost in the superior heights of
Blackcomb, in Cumberland, and the high lands between Kirkby and
Ulverstone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The road from Broughton to Seathwaite is on the banks
of the Duddon, and on its Lancashire side it is of various
elevations.&nbsp; The river is an amusing companion, one while
brawling <a name="pagexx"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xx</span>and tumbling over rocky precipices, until the agitated
water becomes again calm by arriving at a smoother and less
precipitous bed, but its course is soon again ruffled, and the
current thrown into every variety of foam which the rocky channel
of a river can give to water.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Vide Green&rsquo;s
Guide to the Lakes</i>, vol. i. pp. 98&ndash;100.</p>
<p>After all, the traveller would be most gratified who should
approach this beautiful Stream, neither at its source, as is done
in the Sonnets, nor from its termination; but from Coniston over
Walna Scar; first descending into a little circular valley, a
collateral compartment of the long winding vale through which
flows the Duddon.&nbsp; This recess, towards the close of
September, when the after-grass of the meadows is still of a
fresh green, with the leaves of many of the trees faded, but
perhaps none fallen, is truly enchanting.&nbsp; At a point
elevated enough to show the various objects in the valley, and
not so high as to diminish their importance, the stranger will
instinctively halt.&nbsp; On the foreground, little below the
most favourable station, a rude foot-bridge is thrown over the
bed of the noisy brook foaming by the way-side.&nbsp; Russet and
craggy hills, of bold and varied outline, surround the level
valley, which is besprinkled with grey rocks plumed with birch
trees.&nbsp; A few homesteads are interspersed, in some places
peeping out from among the rocks like hermitages, whose site has
been chosen for the benefit of sunshine as well as shelter; in
other instances, the dwelling-house, barn, and byre, compose
together a cruciform structure, which, with its embowering trees,
and the ivy <a name="pagexxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxi</span>clothing part of the walls and roof like a fleece, call
to mind the remains of an ancient abbey.&nbsp; Time, in most
cases, and nature every where, have given a sanctity to the
humble works of man, that are scattered over this peaceful
retirement.&nbsp; Hence a harmony of tone and colour, a
perfection and consummation of beauty, which would have been
marred had aim or purpose interfered with the course of
convenience, utility, or necessity.&nbsp; This unvitiated region
stands in no need of the veil of twilight to soften or disguise
its features.&nbsp; As it glistens in the morning sunshine, it
would fill the spectator&rsquo;s heart with gladsomeness.&nbsp;
Looking from our chosen station, he would feel an impatience to
rove among its pathways, to be greeted by the milkmaid, to wander
from house to house, exchanging &ldquo;good-morrows&rdquo; as he
passed the open doors; but, at evening, when the sun is set, and
a pearly light gleams from the western quarter of the sky, with
an answering light from the smooth surface of the meadows; when
the trees are dusky, but each kind still distinguishable; when
the cool air has condensed the blue smoke rising from the
cottage-chimneys; when the dark mossy stones seem to sleep in the
bed of the foaming Brook; <i>then</i>, he would be unwilling to
move forward, not less from a reluctance to relinquish what he
beholds, than from an apprehension of disturbing, by his
approach, the quietness beneath him.&nbsp; Issuing from the plain
of this valley, the Brook descends in a rapid torrent, passing by
the church-yard of Seathwaite.&nbsp; The traveller is thus
conducted at once into the midst of the wild and beautiful
scenery which gave occasion to the Sonnets from the 14th to <a
name="pagexxii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxii</span>the 20th
inclusive.&nbsp; From the point where the Seathwaite Brook joins
the Duddon, is a view upwards, into the pass through which the
River makes its way into the Plain of Donnerdale.&nbsp; The
perpendicular rock on the right bears the ancient British name of
<span class="smcap">The Pen</span>; the one opposite is called
<span class="smcap">Walla-barrow Crag</span>, a name that occurs
in several places to designate rocks of the same character.&nbsp;
The <i>chaotic</i> aspect of the scene is well marked by the
expression of a stranger, who strolled out while dinner was
preparing, and at his return, being asked by his host,
&ldquo;What way he had been wandering?&rdquo; replied, &ldquo;As
far as it is <i>finished</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bed of the Duddon is here strewn with large fragments of
rocks fallen from aloft; which, as Mr. Green truly says,
&ldquo;are happily adapted to the many-shaped waterfalls,&rdquo;
(or rather water-breaks, for none of them are high,)
&ldquo;displayed in the short space of half a mile.&rdquo;&nbsp;
That there is some hazard in frequenting these desolate places, I
myself have had proof; for one night an immense mass of rock fell
upon the very spot where, with a friend, I had lingered the day
before.&nbsp; &ldquo;The concussion,&rdquo; says Mr. Green,
speaking of the event, (for he also, in the practice of his art,
on that day sat exposed for a still longer time to the same
peril,) &ldquo;was heard, not without alarm, by the neighbouring
shepherds.&rdquo;&nbsp; But to return to Seathwaite Church-yard:
it contains the following inscription.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In memory of the Reverend Robert Walker,
who died the 25th of June, 1802, in the 93rd year of his age, and
67th of his curacy at Seathwaite.</p>
<p><a name="pagexxiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxiii</span>&ldquo;Also, of Anne his wife, who died the 28th of
January, in the 93rd year of her age.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the parish-register of Seathwaite Chapel, is this
notice:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Buried, June 28th, the Rev. Robert
Walker.&nbsp; He was curate of Seathwaite sixty-six years.&nbsp;
He was a man singular for his temperance, industry, and
integrity.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This individual is the Pastor alluded to, in the eighteenth
Sonnet, as a worthy compeer of the Country Parson of Chaucer,
&amp;c.&nbsp; In the Seventh Book of the Excursion, an abstract
of his character is given, beginning&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A Priest abides before whose life such
doubts<br />
Fall to the ground;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and some account of his life, for it is worthy of being
recorded, will not be out of place here.</p>
<h2>MEMOIR OF THE REV. ROBERT WALKER.</h2>
<p>In the year 1709, Robert Walker was born at Under-Crag, in
Seathwaite; he was the youngest of twelve children.&nbsp; His
eldest brother, who inherited the small family estate, died at
Under-Crag, aged ninety-four, being twenty-four years older than
the subject of this Memoir, who was born of the same
mother.&nbsp; Robert was a sickly infant; and, through his
boyhood and youth continuing to be of delicate frame and tender
health, it was deemed best, according to the country phrase, to
<i>breed </i><a name="pagexxiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxiv</span><i>him a scholar</i>; for it was not likely that he
would be able to earn a livelihood by bodily labour.&nbsp; At
that period few of these Dales were furnished with schoolhouses;
the children being taught to read and write in the chapel; and in
the same consecrated building, where he officiated for so many
years both as preacher and schoolmaster, he himself received the
rudiments of his education.&nbsp; In his youth he became
schoolmaster at Lowes-water; not being called upon, probably, in
that situation, to teach more than reading, writing, and
arithmetic.&nbsp; But, by the assistance of a
&ldquo;Gentleman&rdquo; in the neighbourhood, he acquired, at
leisure hours, a knowledge of the classics, and became qualified
for taking holy orders.&nbsp; Upon his ordination, he had the
offer of two curacies; the one, Torver, in the vale of
Coniston,&mdash;the other, Seathwaite, in his native vale.&nbsp;
The value of each was the same, viz. five pounds <i>per
annum</i>: but the cure of Seathwaite having a cottage attached
to it, as he wished to marry, he chose it in preference.&nbsp;
The young person on whom his affections were fixed, though in the
condition of a domestic servant, had given promise, by her
serious and modest deportment, and by her virtuous dispositions,
that she was worthy to become the helpmate of a man entering upon
a plan of life such as he had marked out for himself.&nbsp; By
her frugality she had stored up a small sum of money, with which
they began housekeeping.&nbsp; In 1735 or 1736, he entered upon
his curacy; and nineteen years afterwards, his situation is thus
described, in some letters to be found in the Annual Register for
1760, from which the following is extracted:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><a
name="pagexxv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxv</span>To Mr.
&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Coniston</i>, <i>July</i> 26,
1754.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was the other day upon a party of pleasure, about
five or six miles from this place, where I met with a very
striking object, and of a nature not very common.&nbsp; Going
into a clergyman&rsquo;s house (of whom I had frequently heard) I
found him sitting at the head of a long square table, such as is
commonly used in this country by the lower class of people,
dressed in a coarse blue frock, trimmed with black horn buttons;
a checked shirt, a leathern strap about his neck for a stock, a
coarse apron, and a pair of great wooden-soled shoes, plated with
iron to preserve them, (what we call clogs in these parts,) with
a child upon his knee, eating his breakfast: his wife, and the
remainder of his children, were some of them employed in waiting
upon each other, the rest in teazing and spinning wool, at which
trade he is a great proficient; and moreover, when it is made
ready for sale, will lay it, by sixteen or thirty-two pounds
weight, upon his back, and on foot, seven or eight miles will
carry it to the market, even in the depth of winter.&nbsp; I was
not much surprised at all this, as you may possibly be, having
heard a great deal of it related before.&nbsp; But I must confess
myself astonished with the alacrity and the good humour that
appeared both in the clergyman and his wife, and more so, at the
sense and ingenuity of the clergyman himself.&rdquo; * *</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then follows a letter, from another person, dated 1755, from
which an extract shall be given.</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="pagexxvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxvi</span>&ldquo;By his frugality and good management, he keeps
the wolf from the door, as we say; and if he advances a little in
the world, it is owing more to his own care, than to any thing
else he has to rely upon.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t find his
inclination is running after further preferment.&nbsp; He is
settled among the people, that are happy among themselves; and
lives in the greatest unanimity and friendship with them; and, I
believe, the minister and people are exceedingly satisfied with
each other; and indeed how should they be dissatisfied, when they
have a person of so much worth and probity for their
pastor?&nbsp; A man, who, for his candour and meekness, his
sober, chaste, and virtuous conversation, his soundness in
principle and practice, is an ornament to his profession, and an
honour to the country he is in; and bear with me if I say, the
plainness of his dress, the sanctity of his manners, the
simplicity of his doctrine, and the vehemence of his expression,
have a sort of resemblance to the pure practice of primitive
Christianity.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will now give his own account of himself, to be found in
the same place.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">From the Rev. <span
class="smcap">Robert Walker</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours of the 26th instant was communicated to me by Mr.
C&mdash;, and I should have returned an immediate answer, but the
hand of Providence then lying heavy upon an amiable <a
name="pagexxvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxvii</span>pledge
of conjugal endearment, hath since taken from me a promising
girl, which the disconsolate mother too pensively laments the
loss of; though we have yet eight living, all healthful, hopeful
children, whose names and ages are as follow:&mdash;Zaccheus,
aged almost eighteen years; Elizabeth, sixteen years and ten
months; Mary, fifteen; Moses, thirteen years and three months;
Sarah, ten years and three months; Mabel, eight years and three
months; William Tyson, three years and eight months; and Anne
Esther, one year and three months; besides Anne, who died two
years and six months ago, and was then aged between nine and ten;
and Eleanor, who died the 23rd inst., January, aged six years and
ten months.&nbsp; Zaccheus, the eldest child, is now learning the
trade of tanner, and has two years and a half of his
apprenticeship to serve.&nbsp; The annual income of my chapel at
present, as near as I can compute it, may amount to about
&pound;17 10s., of which is paid in cash, <i>viz.</i> &pound;5
from the bounty of Queen Anne, and &pound;5 from W. P., Esq., of
P&mdash;, out of the annual rents, he being lord of the manor,
and &pound;3 from the several inhabitants of L&mdash;, settled
upon the tenements as a rent-charge; the house and gardens I
value at &pound;4 yearly, and not worth more; and I believe the
surplice fees and voluntary contributions, one year with another,
may be worth &pound;3; but, as the inhabitants are few in number,
and the fees very low, this last-mentioned sum consists merely in
free-will offerings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am situated greatly to my satisfaction with regard to
the conduct and behaviour of my auditory, who not only live in <a
name="pagexxviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxviii</span>the
happy ignorance of the follies and vices of the age, but in
mutual peace and good-will with one another, and are seemingly (I
hope really too) sincere Christians, and sound members of the
Established Church, not one dissenter of any denomination being
amongst them all.&nbsp; I got to the value of &pound;40 for my
wife&rsquo;s fortune, but had no real estate of my own, being the
youngest son of twelve children, born of obscure parents; and,
though my income has been but small, and my family large, yet by
a providential blessing upon my own diligent endeavours, the
kindness of friends, and a cheap country to live in, we have
always had the necessaries of life.&nbsp; By what I have written
(which is a true and exact account, to the best of my knowledge)
I hope you will not think your favour to me, out of the late
worthy Dr. Stratford&rsquo;s effects, quite misbestowed, for
which I must ever gratefully own myself,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Sir,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Your much obliged and most
obedient humble Servant,<br />
R. W., Curate of S&mdash;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Mr. C., of Lancaster.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About the time when this letter was written, the Bishop of
Chester recommended the scheme of joining the curacy of Ulpha to
the contiguous one of Seathwaite, and the nomination was offered
to Mr. Walker; but an unexpected difficulty arising, Mr. W., in a
letter to the Bishop, (a copy of which, in his own beautiful
hand-writing, now lies before me,) thus expresses himself,
&ldquo;If he,&rdquo; meaning the person in whom the <a
name="pagexxix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxix</span>difficulty originated, &ldquo;had suggested any such
objection before, I should utterly have declined any attempt to
the curacy of Ulpha: indeed, I was always apprehensive it might
be disagreeable to my auditory at Seathwaite, as they have been
always accustomed to double duty, and the inhabitants of Ulpha
despair of being able to support a schoolmaster who is not curate
there also; which suppressed all thoughts in me of serving them
both.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in a second letter to the Bishop he
writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the favour of yours of the 1st instant, and am
exceedingly obliged on account of the Ulpha affair: if that
curacy should lapse into your Lordship&rsquo;s hands, I would beg
leave rather to decline than embrace it; for the chapels of
Seathwaite and Ulpha, annexed together, would be apt to cause a
general discontent among the inhabitants of both places; by
either thinking themselves slighted, being only served
alternately, or neglected in the duty, or attributing it to
covetousness in me; all which occasions of murmuring I would
willingly avoid.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, in concluding his former letter, he expresses a similar
sentiment upon the same occasion, &ldquo;desiring, if it be
possible, however, as much as in me lieth, to live peaceably with
all men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The year following, the curacy of Seathwaite was again
augmented; and, to effect this augmentation, fifty pounds had <a
name="pagexxx"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxx</span>been
advanced by himself; and, in 1760, lands were purchased with
eight hundred pounds.&nbsp; Scanty as was his income, the
frequent offer of much better benefices could not tempt Mr. W. to
quit a situation where he had been so long happy, with a
consciousness of being useful.&nbsp; Among his papers I find the
following copy of a letter, dated 1775, twenty years after his
refusal of the curacy of Ulpha, which will show what exertions
had been made for one of his sons.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">May it please your
Grace</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our remote situation here makes it difficult to get the
necessary information for transacting business regularly; such is
the reason of my giving your Grace the present trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bearer (my son) is desirous of offering himself
candidate for deacon&rsquo;s orders at your Grace&rsquo;s ensuing
ordination; the first, on the 25th instant, so that his papers
could not be transmitted in due time.&nbsp; As he is now fully at
age, and I have afforded him education to the utmost of my
ability, it would give me great satisfaction (if your Grace would
take him, and find him qualified) to have him ordained.&nbsp; His
constitution has been tender for some years; he entered the
college of Dublin, but his health would not permit him to
continue there, or I would have supported him much longer.&nbsp;
He has been with me at home above a year, in which time he has
gained great strength of body, sufficient, I hope, to enable him
for performing the function.&nbsp; Divine Providence, assisted by
liberal benefactors, has blest my endeavours, from a small
income, to rear <a name="pagexxxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxi</span>a numerous family; and as my time of life renders me
now unfit for much future expectancy from this world, I should be
glad to see my son settled in a promising way to acquire an
honest livelihood for himself.&nbsp; His behaviour, so far in
life, has been irreproachable; and I hope he will not degenerate,
in principles or practice, from the precepts and pattern of an
indulgent parent.&nbsp; Your Grace&rsquo;s favourable reception
of this, from a distant corner of the diocese, and an obscure
hand, will excite filial gratitude, and a due use shall be made
of the obligation vouchsafed thereby to</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Grace&rsquo;s very dutiful and most obedient</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Son and Servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Robert
Walker</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same man, who was thus liberal in the education of his
numerous family, was even munificent in hospitality as a parish
priest.&nbsp; Every Sunday, were served, upon the long table, at
which he has been described sitting with a child upon his knee,
messes of broth, for the refreshment of those of his congregation
who came from a distance, and usually took their seats as parts
of his own household.&nbsp; It seems scarcely possible that this
custom could have commenced before the augmentation of his cure;
and what would to many have been a high price of self-denial, was
paid, by the pastor and his family, for this gratification; as
the treat could only be provided by dressing at one time the
whole, perhaps, of their weekly allowance of fresh animal food;
consequently, for a succession of days, the <a
name="pagexxxii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxxii</span>table
was covered with cold victuals only.&nbsp; His generosity in old
age may be still further illustrated by a little circumstance
relating to an orphan grandson, then ten years of age, which I
find in a copy of a letter to one of his sons; he requests that
half-a-guinea may be left for &ldquo;little Robert&rsquo;s
pocket-money,&rdquo; who was then at school; intrusting it to the
care of a lady, who, as he says, &ldquo;may sometimes frustrate
his squandering it away foolishly,&rdquo; and promising to send
him an equal allowance annually for the same purpose.&nbsp; The
conclusion of the same letter is so characteristic, that I cannot
forbear to transcribe it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We,&rdquo; meaning his wife and himself,
&ldquo;are in our wonted state of health, allowing for the hasty
strides of old age knocking daily at our door, and threateningly
telling us, we are not only mortal, but must expect ere long to
take our leave of our ancient cottage, and lie down in our last
dormitory.&nbsp; Pray pardon my neglect to answer yours: let us
hear sooner from you, to augment the mirth of the Christmas
holidays.&nbsp; Wishing you all the pleasures of the approaching
season, I am, dear Son, with lasting sincerity, yours
affectionately,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Robert
Walker</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He loved old customs and usages, and in some instances stuck
to them to his own loss; for, having had a sum of money lodged in
the hands of a neighbouring tradesman, when long course of time
had raised the rate of interest, and more was offered, he refused
to accept it; an act not difficult to one, who, while he was
drawing seventeen pounds a year from his <a
name="pagexxxiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxiii</span>curacy, declined, as we have seen, to add the
profits of another small benefice to his own, lest he should be
suspected of cupidity.&mdash;From this vice he was utterly free;
he made no charge for teaching school; such as could afford to
pay, gave him what they pleased.&nbsp; When very young, having
kept a diary of his expenses, however trifling, the large amount,
at the end of the year, surprised him; and from that time the
rule of his life was to be economical, not avaricious.&nbsp; At
his decease he left behind him no less a sum than &pound;2000;
and such a sense of his various excellencies was prevalent in the
country, that the epithet of <span
class="GutSmall">WONDERFUL</span> is to this day attached to his
name.</p>
<p>There is in the above sketch something so extraordinary as to
require further explanatory details.&mdash;And to begin with his
industry; eight hours in each day, during five days in the week,
and half of Saturday, except when the labours of husbandry were
urgent, he was occupied in teaching.&nbsp; His seat was within
the rails of the altar; the communion-table was his desk; and,
like Shenstone&rsquo;s schoolmistress, the master employed
himself at the spinning-wheel, while the children were repeating
their lessons by his side.&nbsp; Every evening, after school
hours, if not more profitably engaged, he continued the same kind
of labour, exchanging, for the benefit of exercise, the small
wheel, at which he had sate, for the large one on which wool is
spun, the spinner stepping to and fro.&nbsp; Thus was the wheel
constantly in readiness to prevent the waste of a moment&rsquo;s
time.&nbsp; Nor was his industry with the pen, when occasion
called for it, less eager.&nbsp; Intrusted with extensive
management <a name="pagexxxiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxiv</span>of public and private affairs, he acted, in his
rustic neighbourhood, as scrivener, writing out petitions, deeds
of conveyance, wills, covenants, etc., with pecuniary gain to
himself, and to the great benefit of his employers.&nbsp; These
labours (at all times considerable) at one period of the year,
viz. between Christmas and Candlemas, when money transactions are
settled in this country, were often so intense, that he passed
great part of the night, and sometimes whole nights, at his
desk.&nbsp; His garden also was tilled by his own hand; he had a
right of pasturage upon the mountains for a few sheep and a
couple of cows, which required his attendance: with this pastoral
occupation, he joined the labours of husbandry upon a small
scale, renting two or three acres in addition to his own less
than one acre of glebe; and the humblest drudgery which the
cultivation of these fields required was performed by
himself.</p>
<p>He also assisted his neighbours in haymaking and shearing
their flocks, and in the performance of this latter service he
was eminently dexterous.&nbsp; They, in their turn, complimented
him with the present of a haycock, or a fleece; less as a
recompense for this particular service than as a general
acknowledgment.&nbsp; The Sabbath was in a strict sense kept
holy; the Sunday evenings being devoted to reading the Scripture
and family prayer.&nbsp; The principal festivals appointed by the
Church were also duly observed; but through every other day in
the week, through every week in the year, he was incessantly
occupied in work of hand or mind; not allowing a moment for
recreation, except upon a Saturday afternoon, when he <a
name="pagexxxv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxxv</span>indulged
himself with a Newspaper, or sometimes with a Magazine.&nbsp; The
frugality and temperance established in his house, were as
admirable as the industry.&nbsp; Nothing to which the name of
luxury could be given was there known; in the latter part of his
life, indeed, when tea had been brought into almost general use,
it was provided for visiters, and for such of his own family as
returned occasionally to his roof and had been accustomed to this
refreshment elsewhere; but neither he nor his wife ever partook
of it.&nbsp; The raiment worn by his family was comely and
decent, but as simple as their diet; the homespun materials were
made up into apparel by their own hands.&nbsp; At the time of the
decease of this thrifty pair, their cottage contained a large
store of webs of woollen and linen cloth, woven from thread of
their own spinning.&nbsp; And it is remarkable that the pew in
the chapel in which the family used to sit remained a few years
ago neatly lined with woollen cloth spun by the pastor&rsquo;s
own hands.&nbsp; It is the only pew in the chapel so
distinguished; and I know of no other instance of his conformity
to the delicate accommodations of modern times.&nbsp; The fuel of
the house, like that of their neighbours, consisted of peat,
procured from the mosses by their own labour.&nbsp; The lights by
which, in the winter evenings, their work was performed, were of
their own manufacture, such as still continue to be used in these
cottages; they are made of the pith of rushes dipped in any
unctuous substance that the house affords.&nbsp; White candles,
as tallow candles are here called, were reserved to honour the
Christmas festivals, and were perhaps produced <a
name="pagexxxvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxxvi</span>upon no
other occasions.&nbsp; Once a month, during the proper season, a
sheep was drawn from their small mountain flock, and killed for
the use of the family; and a cow towards the close of the year,
was salted and dried, for winter provision: the hide was tanned
to furnish them with shoes.&mdash;By these various resources,
this venerable clergyman reared a numerous family, not only
preserving them, as he affectingly says, &ldquo;from wanting the
necessaries of life;&rdquo; but afforded them an unstinted
education, and the means of raising themselves in society.</p>
<p>It might have been concluded that no one could thus, as it
were, have converted his body into a machine of industry for the
humblest uses, and kept his thoughts so frequently bent upon
secular concerns, without grievous injury to the more precious
parts of his nature.&nbsp; How could the powers of intellect
thrive, or its graces be displayed, in the midst of circumstances
apparently so unfavourable, and where to the direct cultivation
of the mind, so small a portion of time was allotted?&nbsp; But,
in this extraordinary man, things in their nature adverse were
reconciled; his conversation was remarkable, not only for being
chaste and pure, but for the degree in which it was fervent and
eloquent; his written style was correct, simple, and
animated.&nbsp; Nor did his <i>affections</i> suffer more than
his intellect; he was tenderly alive to all the duties of his
pastoral office: the poor and needy &ldquo;he never sent empty
away,&rdquo;&mdash;the stranger was fed and refreshed in passing
that unfrequented vale&mdash;the sick were visited; and the
feelings of humanity found further exercise among the distresses
and <a name="pagexxxvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxvii</span>embarrassments in the worldly estate of his
neighbours, with which his talents for business made him
acquainted; and the disinterestedness, impartiality, and
uprightness which he maintained in the management of all affairs
confided to him, were virtues seldom separated in his own
conscience from religious obligations.&nbsp; Nor could such
conduct fail to remind those who witnessed it of a spirit nobler
than law or custom: they felt convictions which, but for such
intercourse, could not have been afforded, that, as in the
practice of their pastor, there was no guile, so in his faith
there was nothing hollow; and we are warranted in believing, that
upon these occasions, selfishness, obstinacy, and discord would
often give way before the breathings of his good-will and saintly
integrity.&nbsp; It may be presumed also, while his humble
congregation were listening to the moral precepts which he
delivered from the pulpit, and to the Christian exhortations that
they should love their neighbour as themselves, and do as they
would be done unto, that peculiar efficacy was given to the
preacher&rsquo;s labours by recollections in the minds of his
congregation, that they were called upon to do no more than his
own actions were daily setting before their eyes.</p>
<p>The afternoon service in the chapel was less numerously
attended than that of the morning, but by a more serious
auditory; the lesson from the New Testament, on those occasions,
was accompanied by Birkett&rsquo;s Commentaries.&nbsp; These
lessons he read with impassioned emphasis, frequently drawing
tears from his hearers, and leaving a lasting impression upon
their <a name="pagexxxviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxxviii</span>minds.&nbsp; His devotional feelings and the powers
of his own mind were further exercised, along with those of his
family, in perusing the Scriptures; not only on the Sunday
evenings, but on every other evening, while the rest of the
household were at work, some one of the children, and in her turn
the servant, for the sake of practice in reading, or for
instruction, read the Bible aloud; and in this manner the whole
was repeatedly gone through.&nbsp; That no common importance was
attached to the observance of religious ordinances by his family,
appears from the following memorandum by one of his descendants,
which I am tempted to insert at length, as it is characteristic,
and somewhat curious.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is a small chapel in the
county palatine of Lancaster, where a certain clergyman has
regularly officiated above sixty years, and a few months ago
administered the sacrament of the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>&rsquo;s Supper in the same, to a decent
number of devout communicants.&nbsp; After the clergyman had
received himself, the first company out of the assembly who
approached the altar, and kneeled down to be partakers of the
sacred elements, consisted of the parson&rsquo;s wife, to whom he
had been married upwards of sixty years; one son and his wife;
four daughters, each with her husband; whose ages, all added
together, amounted to above 714 years.&nbsp; The several and
respective distances from the place of each of their abodes to
the chapel where they all communicated, will measure more than
1000 English miles.&nbsp; Though the narration will appear
surprising, it is without doubt a fact that the same persons,
exactly four years before, met at the <a

place, and all joined in performance of the same venerable
duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was indeed most zealously attached to the doctrine and
frame of the Established Church.&nbsp; We have seen him
congratulating himself that he had no dissenters in his cure of
any denomination.&nbsp; Some allowance must be made for the state
of opinion when his first religious impressions were received,
before the reader will acquit him of bigotry, when I mention,
that at the time of the augmentation of the cure, he refused to
invest part of the money in the purchase of an estate offered to
him upon advantageous terms, because the proprietor was a
Quaker;&mdash;whether from scrupulous apprehension that a
blessing would not attend a contract framed for the benefit of
the Church between persons not in religious sympathy with each
other; or, as a seeker of peace, he was afraid of the uncomplying
disposition which at one time was too frequently conspicuous in
that sect.&nbsp; Of this an instance had fallen under his own
notice; for, while he taught school at Loweswater, certain
persons of that denomination had refused to pay annual interest
due under the title of Church-stock; <a
name="citationxxxix"></a><a href="#footnotexxxix"
class="citation">[xxxix]</a> a great hardship upon the incumbent,
for the curacy of Loweswater was then scarcely less poor than
that of Seathwaite.&nbsp; To what degree this prejudice of his
was blameable need not be determined;&mdash;certain it is, that
he was not only desirous, as he himself says, <a
name="pagexl"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xl</span>to live in
peace, but in love, with all men.&nbsp; He was placable, and
charitable in his judgments; and, however correct in conduct and
rigorous to himself, he was ever ready to forgive the trespasses
of others, and to soften the censure that was cast upon their
frailties.&mdash;It would be unpardonable to omit that, in the
maintenance of his virtues, he received due support from the
Partner of his long life.&nbsp; She was equally strict in
attending to a share of their joint cares, nor less diligent in
her appropriate occupations.&nbsp; A person who had been some
time their servant in the latter part of their lives, concluded
the panegyric of her mistress by saying to me, &ldquo;she was no
less excellent than her husband; she was good to the poor, she
was good to every thing!&rdquo;&nbsp; He survived for a short
time this virtuous companion.&nbsp; When she died, he ordered
that her body should be borne to the grave by three of her
daughters and one grand-daughter; and, when the corpse was lifted
from the threshold, he insisted upon lending his aid, and feeling
about, for he was then almost blind, took hold of a napkin fixed
to the coffin; and, as a bearer of the body, entered the Chapel,
a few steps from the lowly Parsonage.</p>
<p>What a contrast does the life of this obscurely-seated, and,
in point of worldly wealth, poorly-repaid Churchman, present to
that of Cardinal Wolsey!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O &rsquo;tis a burthen, Cromwell,
&rsquo;tis a burthen,<br />
Too heavy for a man who hopes for heaven!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have been dwelling upon images of peace in the moral <a
name="pagexli"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xli</span>world, that
have brought us again to the quiet enclosure of consecrated
ground, in which this venerable pair lie interred.&nbsp; The
sounding brook, that rolls close by the church-yard without
disturbing feeling or meditation, is now unfortunately laid bare;
but not long ago it participated, with the chapel, the shade of
some stately ash-trees, which will not spring again.&nbsp; While
the spectator from this spot is looking round upon the girdle of
stony mountains that encompasses the vale,&mdash;masses of rock,
out of which monuments for all men that ever existed might have
been hewn, it would surprise him to be told, as with truth he
might be, that the plain blue slab dedicated to the memory of
this aged pair, is a production of a quarry in North Wales!&nbsp;
It was sent as a mark of respect by one of their descendants from
the vale of Festiniog, a region almost as beautiful as that in
which it now lies.</p>
<p>Upon the Seathwaite Brook, at a small distance from the
Parsonage, has been erected a mill for spinning yarn; it is a
mean and disagreeable object, though not unimportant to the
spectator, as calling to mind the momentous changes wrought by
such inventions in the frame of society&mdash;changes which have
proved especially unfavourable to these mountain solitudes.&nbsp;
So much had been effected by those new powers, before the subject
of the preceding biographical sketch closed his life, that their
operation could not escape his notice, and doubtless excited
touching reflections upon the comparatively insignificant results
of his own manual industry.&nbsp; But Robert Walker was not a man
of times and circumstances: had he lived at a <a
name="pagexlii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xlii</span>later
period, the principle of duty would have produced application as
unremitting; the same energy of character would have been
displayed, though in many instances with widely-different
effects.</p>
<p>Having mentioned in this narrative the vale of Loweswater as a
place where Mr. Walker taught school, I will add a few memoranda
from its parish register, respecting a person apparently of
desires as moderate, with whom he must have been intimate during
his residence there.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let him that would, ascend the tottering

Of courtly grandeur, and become as great<br />

<p>&ldquo;This Curacy was twice augmented by Queen Anne&rsquo;s

to Mr. John Curwen, of London, on the 9th of May, 1724, deposited
by me, Henry Forest, Curate of Loweswater.&nbsp; Y<sup>e</sup>
said 9th of May, y<sup>e</sup> said Mr. Curwen went to the
office, and saw my name registered there, &amp;c.&nbsp; This, by

assisted Robert Walker in his classical studies at
Loweswater.</p>

<p>With pleasure I annex, as illustrative and confirmatory of the
above account, Extracts from a Paper in the Christian
Remembrancer, October, 1819: it bears an assumed signature, but
is known to be the work of the Rev. Robert Bamford, vicar of
Bishopton, in the county of Durham; a great-grandson of Mr.
Walker, whose worth it commemorates, by a record not the less
valuable for being written in very early youth.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;His house was a nursery of virtue.&nbsp;
All the inmates were industrious, and cleanly, and happy.&nbsp;
Sobriety, neatness, quietness, characterised the whole
family.&nbsp; No railings, no idleness, no indulgence of passion,
were permitted.&nbsp; Every child, however young, had its
appointed engagements; every hand was busy.&nbsp; Knitting,
spinning, reading, writing, mending clothes, making shoes, were
by the different children constantly performing.&nbsp; The father
himself sitting amongst them, and guiding their thoughts, was
engaged in the same occupations.</p>

family were at rest, he retired to a little room which he had
built on the roof of his house.&nbsp; He had slated it, and
fitted it up with shelves for his books, his stock of cloth,
wearing apparel, and his utensils.&nbsp; There many a cold
winter&rsquo;s night, without fire, while the roof was glazed
with ice, did he remain reading or writing, till the day
dawned.&nbsp; He taught the children in the chapel, for there was
no school-house.&nbsp; Yet in that cold, damp place he never had
a fire.&nbsp; He used to send the children in parties either to
his own fire at home, or make them run up the mountain&rsquo;s

greatest pleasure to view the rising sun; and in tranquil
evenings, as it slided behind the hills, he blessed its
departure.&nbsp; He was skilled in fossils and plants: a constant
observer of the stars and winds: the atmosphere was his
delight.&nbsp; He made many experiments on its nature and
properties.&nbsp; In summer he used to gather a multitude of
flies and insects, and, by his entertaining description, amuse
and instruct his children.&nbsp; They shared all his daily
employments, and derived many sentiments of love and benevolence
from his observations on the works and productions of
nature.&nbsp; Whether they were following him in the field, or
surrounding him in school, he took every opportunity of storing
their minds with useful information.&mdash;Nor <a

and the authority of virtue, had such an effect upon my mind,
that I never see a hoary-headed clergyman, without thinking of
Mr. Walker * * * *.&nbsp; He allowed no dissenter or methodist to
interfere in the instruction of the souls committed to his cure:
and so successful were his exertions, that he had not one
dissenter of any denomination whatever in the whole
parish.&mdash;Though he avoided all religious controversies, yet
when age had silvered his head, and virtuous piety had secured to
his appearance reverence and silent honour, no one, however
determined in his hatred of apostolic descent, could have
listened to his discourse on ecclesiastical history, and ancient

returned to mortality, and in that vale of peace had come to

never preached with steadiness after his wife&rsquo;s

He became, when alone, sad and melancholy, though still among his
friends kind and good-humoured.&nbsp; He went to bed about twelve

was, he went, tottering and leaning upon his daughter&rsquo;s
arm, to examine the heavens, and meditate a few moments in the

OLD-CHURCH CLOCK.</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Trouble is a thing that will come without our
call: but true joy will not spring up without ourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bishop
Patrick</span>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Heart&rsquo;s
Ease</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One fine day last spring&mdash;(and fine days are not so
common in Manchester, at that season of the year, as to make them
easily forgotten)&mdash;one fine day I was crossing the new
Victoria bridge, from the Manchester to the Salford side of the
river, when my attention was arrested by a middle-aged person, (I
had nearly written gentleman, but that word would not have
conveyed quite an accurate idea to the reader,) who was gazing
very steadily over the battlements, at the <span
class="smcap">Old Church Clock</span>.&nbsp; He was a person whom
I had often remarked strolling about the streets of the town, and
whom I felt myself to be perfectly acquainted with, by sight,
though I had no idea whatever of his name or occupation.&nbsp;
Occupation, indeed, I felt almost assured he had none, or at
least not one which demanded any considerable portion of his
time; for, besides his age, which was evidently too advanced to
permit him to discharge any very laborious duties, he was more <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>abroad in the
open air, than was consistent with any constant or indispensable
calling.&nbsp; His dress was of a description which implied
something above want, though not much; for, like its wearer, it
had seen better days; moreover, it showed its owner to be a man
not given to change; for it was of a fashion more in vogue thirty
years ago, than at the present time.&nbsp; Over a coat that had
once been of a blacker dye than now, he wore a <i>spencer</i>, or
short great-coat, buttoned up to the chin.&nbsp; His
small-clothes were strictly what their name implies, closely
buttoned at the knees.&nbsp; His legs were comfortably encased in
thick woollen stockings, which received additional warmth from a
pair of short black gaiters, which clothed his ancles.&nbsp;
Altogether he had rather the air of a country schoolmaster, with
more scholars than fees, taking the air on a half-holiday.&nbsp;
This respectable personage was (as I said) gazing steadfastly at
the <span class="smcap">Old Church Clock</span>, over the
battlements of the bridge: he had his own watch in his hand, of
ample size and antique appearance; and I saw that he was going to
regulate its time by that of the venerable old time-teller in the
tower of the Collegiate Church.&nbsp; Knowing that at that moment
the Old Church clock was not, as they say &ldquo;quite
right,&rdquo; (for friend <span class="smcap">Peter Clare</span>
is sometimes much more attentive to the accuracy of his own
external appearance, than to the correctness of those measurers
of time, which her majesty&rsquo;s subjects have committed to his
regulation,) I could not resist the inclination to caution one,
whom I almost considered an old acquaintance, against being led
into error, by setting his own watch to a clock which was at
least five minutes behind the hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said I, (taking out my own watch at
the same time, to give some force to my words,) &ldquo;that clock
is six minutes too slow.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It may be so,
sir,&rdquo; said he, looking at me quite in the way that I had
looked at him, viz. as an old acquaintance, &ldquo;it may be so,
but I always set my watch by that clock, every week, whether it
be right or wrong!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed
I, &ldquo;that seems a strange fancy.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It may
be so,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and perhaps it is.&nbsp; But, sir,
I know that clock of old; five and <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>forty years I have gone by it, and it
has never led me far wrong yet.&nbsp; It has saved me some good
thrashings, and more hard money; to say nothing of better things
it has done for me.&nbsp; It is now the oldest friend I have in
Manchester, and I keep up my acquaintance with it, by setting my
watch by it every Saturday; and, with <span
class="smcap">God</span>&rsquo;s blessing, so long as I live in
Manchester, (and it is very likely, now, that I may live here
till I die,) I will set my watch by that clock, be it right or
wrong!&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a mixture of joke and earnest in
the old man&rsquo;s manner, as he said this, like one who feels
that what he says seriously may yet be open to ridicule; and I
could not help replying, in a tone somewhat similar to his
own&mdash;&ldquo;Well, I never heard so much said in favour of
the Old Church clock before!&nbsp; As we are walking in the same
direction, perhaps you will give me some particulars as to your
acquaintance with that old clock, and of the good which you have
had out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be rather a long story, sir: but I am getting
to an age when it is a pleasure to me to tell long stories,
especially about myself&mdash;I have little else to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here there was a pause of some duration; and I saw an anxious
expression on the old man&rsquo;s features, either as if he was
somewhat startled with the task which he had undertaken, or did
not quite know where to begin: probably both feelings were in his
mind, for in about half a minute, he raised his eyes a little,
which had been, till then, fixed on the ground, and said, as if
half to me and half to himself, &ldquo;I think it will be best to
begin at the beginning.&nbsp; He will like to hear of my young
days, and it is a pleasure to me to go over them again.&nbsp; I
was not, sir, born in Manchester; indeed, I hardly ever knew any
body that was!&nbsp; Many come from Ireland, like pigs, and they
live like pigs; and many from the north, like woodcocks and
fieldfares,&mdash;some grow fat like fieldfares, and some grow
lean like woodcocks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I now found that my new friend had some humour in his
conversation; and I confess, I did not like him the worse for
it.&nbsp; He continued:&mdash;&ldquo;I am from the north.&nbsp;
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>I was born
in one of the wildest parts of the country you ever saw, in the
midst of lakes and mountains.&nbsp; It has been fashionable
lately to visit the lake country, but most persons go in their
carriages or on horseback, and they miss the very finest parts
and the grandest scenes.&nbsp; I did not think much of the
beauties of the country then; but since I left it, and came to
live in this smoky dungeon, my heart has often gone back to the
place of my birth; and it now looks much more beautiful in my
mind than it did then to my eyes, or than it probably would if I
were ever to see it again.&mdash;I wonder if that will ever
be!&rdquo;&mdash;he here half whispered to
himself&mdash;&ldquo;Sir, the house in which I was born stood in
one of the most retired parts of the lake country&mdash;a spot, I
dare say, never visited at all by strangers.&nbsp; They call it
<i>Yewdale</i>.&nbsp; The house (I see it now!) was low, and
built of cobbles, but firm as a rock; one end, indeed, had fallen
in, and was used as a hen-roost and cart-house, but the main part
of the house was well slated with good brown flat stones, out of
Coniston Old Man, and had two chimneys at the top as tall and
round as a churn.&nbsp; The house stood on the side of the hill,
just where the road makes a turn to run right down upon Coniston
Water Head.&nbsp; There was a great broad plane tree at the end
of it,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;and a large thorn before the
door,&rdquo; interrupted I, &ldquo;with the top of it cut into
the shape of a cock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly so!&rdquo; exclaimed he, looking up into my
face with much surprise, &ldquo;why you have seen the very
place!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure I have, and that the very last summer, when
I was strolling about Yewdale and Tilberthwaite, the finest part
of all the lake country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, sir!&rdquo; said he, his native dialect
unconsciously returning with his early
recollections,&mdash;&ldquo;Eh, sir, and is it not a <i>bonny
bit</i>?&mdash;and so the old cock is still crowing on the top of
the old thorn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it <i>was</i>,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but as I
passed by, I saw a ladder reared up to its side, and a decent
looking man, apparently the owner, diligently employed, with a
pair of shears, in cutting off the cock&rsquo;s tail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound Tom Hebblethwaite,&rdquo; said my companion,
more seriously <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>vexed than I thought it possible for him to
be,&mdash;&ldquo;I wish&mdash;but I am a fool for being angry
with him&mdash;what better could be expected from him?&nbsp; At
school he was always a stupid fellow; he never could catch a
trout out of the lake in his life, and whenever he tried to rob a
hen-roost, he was sure to tumble down the ladder, and waken all
the cocks and hens in the parish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was much amused at the reasons which the old man assigned
why nothing good could be expected from Tom Hebblethwaite, but
said nothing more to provoke his indignation, which I saw he soon
became rather ashamed of.&nbsp; After a pause he regained his
wonted composure, and proceeded:&mdash;&ldquo;In that house I was
born.&nbsp; My earliest recollection is the death of my
grandmother.&nbsp; I do not know how old she was, but she must
have been near a hundred years old.&nbsp; I yet remember her
calling me to her bed side, just before her death, giving me a
shilling, which she seemed to have concealed somewhere about the
bed-clothes, and saying, in a deep and earnest tone, &lsquo;God
bless you.&rsquo;&nbsp; She died that night.&nbsp; I have never
forgotten her blessing, and I have never parted with her
shilling&mdash;I never will!&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a tear in his
eye as he said this, and he paused for a few moments in his
narrative.</p>
<h3><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>CHAPTER
II.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky

<br />
Than in the perfum&rsquo;d chambers of the great,<br />

And lull&rsquo;d with sounds of sweetest melody!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Shakspere</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My</span> early days,&rdquo; the
old man continued, &ldquo;were, as all the rest have been, a
mixture of happiness and troubles.&nbsp; I believe the troubles
were, at the time, rather the more abundant part, though, in
looking back on my past days I remember the bright spots more
distinctly than the dark: just as, in youth, I have stood on
Yewdale crag, and distinctly seen the distant top of Snafell in
the Isle of Man, because a sunbeam happened to fall on it, while
all was dark and indistinct around it.&nbsp; My father was a
little <i>Statesman</i>; by which, as you know, is not meant, in
Cumberland, any thing like Lord John Russell, as such a term
would be understood in Manchester; for he never, I believe, read
a newspaper in his life; nay, probably never saw one, unless it
might be upon Lady le Fleming&rsquo;s hall table, when he went,
as he did, once a year, to Rydal, to pay his boon rent to her, as
lady of the manor.&nbsp; A statesman, in Cumberland, is the owner
of a little land; and as proud he is of his little holding, as
Sir Robert Peel can be (and proud indeed he may be!) of governing
the state.&nbsp; How long we had lived upon this little estate, I
cannot tell, nor, I suppose, any body else.&nbsp; There were no
title deeds in existence; nor, I believe, many wills, if
any.&nbsp; When the father <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>died, the son quietly buried him in
Hawkshead church-yard, and then as quietly stepped into his
shoes, wore out his old coats, (if they could be worn out,) and
every thing went on just as before.&nbsp; My father was the most
silent man I ever met with in my life.&nbsp; He never spoke
unless he had something to say, and that seemed to be only once
or twice in the course of the day.&nbsp; He was always the first
up in the morning, and the last in bed at night, and worked like
a slave on his farm from sunrise to sunset.&nbsp; Of course I
could not understand his character then, but I have often tried
to understand it since he was taken away, and I became capable of
reflection.&nbsp; He never shewed me much kindness, but was never
harsh, though always firm.&nbsp; I had great respect for him,
because I saw my neighbours had; and I believe it is true,
generally, that children learn to value their parents a good deal
by the way in which they see them treated by indifferent
persons.&nbsp; All my life I have always treated parents with
respect in the presence of their children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my good friend,&rdquo; interrupted I,
&ldquo;for that hint; I will put that down in my memorandum
book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; said he, smiling, &ldquo;it will
at least do no harm there; nor, I believe, would it do any, if
you were to put it into practice!&nbsp; But to go on with my long
story.&nbsp; My mother,&mdash;sir, I do not know how I shall get
on now.&nbsp; I feel a rising in my throat at the recollection of
her very name; and though she has been dead and gone many a long
year, yet every thing that she said, and every thing that she
did&mdash;her quiet smile&mdash;her linsey-woolsey
petticoat&mdash;her silver shoe-buckles&mdash;her smooth gray
hair turned back in a roll over her calm forehead&mdash;her soft
voice, making the broad Cumberland dialect sweeter, even to the
ear of a stranger, than the richest music&mdash;her patience in
pain&mdash;her unchanging kindness to me in all my wayward moods
and fits of passion&mdash;her regularity in all her devotions,
public and private, come at this moment as fresh into my mind, as
if she were sitting now in the corner of my little dwelling in
Salford, instead of sleeping as she has <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>done for many a long year, quietly and
peaceably, in the south-east corner of Hawkshead
church-yard.&nbsp; There is no stone over her grave; but I could
find it blind-fold even now, though it is many a day since I have
stood beside it&mdash;and it concerns no one else to know where
it is but myself.&nbsp; I sometimes wish to be buried beside
her&mdash;but what does it signify? we could not know each other
in the grave&mdash;we <i>shall</i> know each other, with joy
<i>shall</i> meet again hereafter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a passionate earnestness in the old man&rsquo;s
manner as he uttered these last words, which differed strongly
from the general quiet tone of his narrative.&nbsp; I kept
silence when he paused, out of respect for his feelings, and
waited for the return of his wonted calmness, which he was not
long in regaining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother taught me to read almost as soon as I could
speak.&nbsp; The book she used for that purpose was the
Testament.&nbsp; It was almost the only book in the house, except
the Whole Duty of Man, and four or five black-letter volumes,
tinged with smoke from having lain for ages in the chimney
corner, the contents of which not the oldest man in all Yewdale
even pretended to understand.&nbsp; By the time I was five years
old, being a strong, hale boy, my father tried to make me useful
about the farm, in feeding the cows, or looking after the sheep;
but it would not do.&nbsp; I had hardly strength for the former
task; and as to looking after the sheep, the temptation of
joining two or three similar shepherds in an expedition of
bird-nesting or nut-gathering, was always too strong to be
resisted.&nbsp; Proving thus unequal to these important duties,
my father determined to find me one which required, (in public
opinion at that time,) abilities of a narrower range.&nbsp; I
heard him say one night to my mother, after I had gone to my snug
roost in the loft, where I generally slept like a
top,&mdash;&lsquo;I think there is nothing for it but to make the
lad a scholar&mdash;may be a parson.&rsquo;&nbsp; To this my
mother readily consented; and the day after, I was furnished with
a satchel, and sent off, with two or three other boys of the
dale, to Hawkshead school, to be made a scholar!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I <span class="GutSmall">BELIEVE</span>,&rdquo;
continued the old man, &ldquo;that if a man were to live an
hundred years,&mdash;so long as to forget every thing else that
ever happened to him, he would never forget the first day of his
going to school!&nbsp; I am sure <i>I</i> never shall.&nbsp; I
recollect at this moment, as well or better than if it had taken
place yesterday, every thing that happened, every thing that I
did and saw, nay, every thing that I thought on that
all-important day.&nbsp; When I first woke in the morning, I
knew, before I opened my eyes, that something particular was
going to happen, though it was some time before I was
sufficiently wide awake to call to mind exactly what it
was.&nbsp; When it at last flashed across me that I was that day
going for the first time to school, I jumped into the middle of
the floor, and was dressed, (and in my best suit of fustians,) in
half my usual time.&nbsp; I shall never forget the care with
which my good mother packed up my little dinner in my bag,
putting my spelling-book carefully on the top of it, nor the
pleased look with which she put my new hat on my head, and bid me
to &lsquo;be a good boy.&rsquo;&nbsp; I recollect I thought at
that time, as I started off&mdash;&lsquo;to be sure I shall; how
could any one doubt it!&rsquo; but I said nothing: I was in too
great haste to join my young companions, whom I heard hallooing
out for me from the top of the hill.&nbsp; What a glorious
morning it was!&nbsp; I told you that <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>I did not care, then, much about the
scenes of nature; nor did I ever much think or talk about
them.&nbsp; It is not the custom in that country; for men are
there too familiar with them to make them the subject of their
daily conversation.&nbsp; But the impression which they made on
me shows that I felt them; for there was not a beam of sunshine
or a cloud that crossed my path on that morning, which I do not
recollect, at this moment, as distinctly as the everlasting hills
over which they passed&mdash;never to visit them
again!&rdquo;&nbsp; A shade passed over the old man&rsquo;s
countenance, and I fancied he was thinking, that he himself might
be compared to the cloud and the sunshine, never more to visit
his native hills.&nbsp; &ldquo;The sun was rising right over the
top of Penigent, as I and my young companions reached the brow of
the hill from which the road descends down upon the quiet village
of Hawkshead.&nbsp; His rays just crossed the point on which we
stood, and stretched across, like so many golden rules or lines
of light, to the top of Coniston Old Man, and the side of
Bowfell, leaving Yewdale and Coniston Water Head lost in mist and
darkness.&nbsp; The birds were singing on the heights, the cattle
lowing to be milked in the valleys below, and the sheep bleating
on a thousand hills The whole air was filled, as far as the eye
could reach, with the glittering spider&rsquo;s web, or gossamer,
of which nobody, I believe, could ever yet give a clear account;
and every bunch of heath and whin-bush was sparkling with drops
of dew so full and large, as to seem ready to fall like a shower
of rain upon the ground.&nbsp; There stood we, three raw lads of
the dale, setting out in the world for the first time, and
certainly looking out upon as bright a prospect before us, as
ever cheered the sight of any adventurous youths, going forth to
seek their fortunes in the world!&nbsp; Alas! the prospect has
often been sadly dimmed since then!&nbsp; On many a dark scene
have I looked, and many a melancholy pang has shot through my
heart since I gazed down, as I did then, in such bright hopes and
high spirits, from the top of that hill, upon the lowly roof of
Hawkshead School!&nbsp; But <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>what of that?&nbsp; Sorrow would have
come, even if joy had not come before it! and the recollections
of my youth, instead of being a ground of repining at my
after-lot, have a thousand times been a subject of heartfelt
comfort; as I have ever felt that <span class="smcap">God</span>
did not intend me to be miserable; but that all my sorrow has
arisen, either from my own vices and follies, or from those of my
brother-men.&nbsp; I have often thought, sir, what a contrast
does my first school-day present with that of thousands of the
poor children in this wretched town of ours, who go for the first
time to their Infant or Sunday school, with no such brilliant sun
to light them on their way,&mdash;with no such mountain prospects
and bracing air to gladden their hearts, and breathe health into
their sickly frames,&mdash;with no such well-filled satchel
prepared by the hands of a watchful and pious mother; but through
dingy and soot-discoloured streets, without a single ray of the
sun, unless it be as yellow as a marigold, with but a crust of
dry bread for breakfast, which the mother puts into her
child&rsquo;s hand that she may at once indulge herself in her
bed, and get rid of the care of her offspring for the remainder
of the day.&mdash;Oh, sir! too truly has it been said by the
poet,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;&lsquo;<span
class="smcap">God</span> made the country, but Man made the
town.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I fear, my good friend,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that your
recollections of early youth have prejudiced you against the
manifold benefits arising to society from the manufacturing
system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;by no manner of
means; as you shall hear by and by.&nbsp; But here have I been
talking about myself in a most unreasonable way, and kept you
waiting all the while, at the door of Hawkshead school!&nbsp; Let
us walk in, if you please!&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">The Ayrshire
Tragedy</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old gentleman&rsquo;s narrative
had, I confess, grown interesting to me.&nbsp; I am always
anxious, not only to study characters as they exist, but to learn
how characters have been formed.&nbsp; I believe we all pay too
little attention to this, when we blame men for their vices, or
praise them for their virtues.&nbsp; If we find an oak in the
forest knotted and gnarled, with his limbs distorted, and his
trunk bending down to the ground instead of towering majestically
to the sky, we blame not the old oak for his deformity, nor
reproach him with the waste of many a long year in which he has
been visited by the refreshing dews of the heaven above, and the
fatness of the earth beneath.&nbsp; We are sure that there were
causes, though we do not now perceive them, which obstructed and
stunted his early growth, and made him what he is, and must now
ever remain.&nbsp; The natural soil might be barren, his early
shoots might have been cropped by the browzing sheep, or his top
might be overshadowed, and the beams of the sun prevented from
cherishing his growth, by some more fortunate tree, which has
long since fallen before the woodman&rsquo;s axe, but not till it
had dried up all the vital <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>energies of the withered old stump
before us.&nbsp; And as it is with oaks, so, in some respects,
with men.&nbsp; The soil in which they first strike root, the
sunshine under which they grow, the influence of other minds on
their early habits and opinions, are all to be considered when we
sit in judgment on men in after life, and attempt to measure the
praise or blame which is due to their moral or religious
conduct.&nbsp; It is true, that man differs from the oak in this,
that <i>he</i> can take an active part in forming his own
character.&nbsp; <i>He</i> can change his soil, seek the
sunshine, remove from evil neighbourhood, and fly from the
influence of dangerous example.&nbsp; But how seldom has he
firmness and grace for this!&nbsp; How truly does he resemble the
oak in this, that he becomes, through life, what the early
circumstances of his youth have made him!&nbsp; Hence, I am
always anxious to know men&rsquo;s histories from the very
beginning.&nbsp; Even slight matters, in childhood, produce
permanent effects; and I like to hear little anecdotes of youth,
which some men regard as trivial, because I know (as a great poet
has said) that &ldquo;the child is father to the man,&rdquo; and
that education begins even with life itself.&nbsp; A certain
French lady wished to consult a philosopher about the best mode
of educating her child, and said that she was commencing at a
very early period, as her child was but three years
old:&mdash;&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said the philosopher, &ldquo;you
are beginning three years too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hence, as I said, I was glad to find the old man so willing to
narrate his history, and to have so perfect a memory of his early
days, as I expected thus to learn a lesson in the formation of
human character, the most important study to which the human mind
can be directed.&nbsp; But I confess I was somewhat startled when
he invited me, as he termed it, to &ldquo;walk with him into
Hawskhead school,&rdquo; as I dreaded what is commonly called a
long yarn, more especially as the course of our walk together was
now drawing to a termination.&nbsp; &ldquo;My good friend,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;I would listen to you with the greatest pleasure,
but there is <i>one</i> school-boy taste which we never lose
sight <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>of
as long as we live, viz., an accurate knowledge of the dinner
hour; and mine, I feel, is approaching.&nbsp; I shall be most
happy to resume our walk and our talk together to-morrow morning,
when I hope we shall be able to get through your first school-day
with mutual pleasure and satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said the old man, smiling,
&ldquo;but a full stomach has seldom much feeling for an empty
one.&mdash;Mine happens to be in that more favourable condition
at the present moment, and thankful am I to <span
class="smcap">God</span> for it, for I can remember the day when
I have been reduced to feed my eyes instead of my mouth at the
butcher&rsquo;s shop?&nbsp; But I am really anxious to give you a
specimen of my early school-days, because I was brought up under
a system of instruction which is now rapidly passing away.&nbsp;
At every town, and almost every village in the north of England,
there was, and indeed still is, a grammar school; generally
pretty well endowed as to income, and under the management of a
master and usher, one if not both, educated at one of the
universities of Oxford or Cambridge.&nbsp; All the learning
required at the time when they were founded was Latin and Greek,
and the masters of these schools were full of both.&nbsp; The
schools were free to all who came to them, so that the little
statesman or farmer, who happened to live near one of them, could
give his son as good an education as the first nobleman in the
land, and at no further expense than providing his child with
meat and clothing.&nbsp; These lads were brought up with frugal
and industrious habits, and told from their very childhood, that
if they made themselves good scholars, they might hereafter
become bishops, or judges of the land, which in those days often
came to pass.&nbsp; One or two of the oldest bishops on the bench
at this moment, sprang out of these grammar schools; and many of
our most distinguished lawyers.&nbsp; But they are now, most of
them, I hear, at a very low ebb.&nbsp; The school-house is
falling down, and the little village around it, which was
supported by the pupils and boarders, is pining away.&nbsp; This
<a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>is a sad
blow, sir, to the poor north.&mdash;The farmer&rsquo;s son gets
not that good education that he used to have, and is bound down
for ever to his plough and his flail, instead of rising to be one
of the ornaments of his country, and a benefactor to his poor
native land.&nbsp; Pray, sir, can you account for the falling off
in these good old schools?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many reasons for it,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;some of which might be removed, and some not.&nbsp; One
reason is, that noblemen and gentlemen now send their sons to be
educated either at the great public schools, or at private
academies, where they meet only with persons of their own rank,
and escape the mischiefs which are supposed to arise from mixing
with persons beneath them in birth or station.&mdash;Great folly
this.&nbsp; The best part of education consists in becoming
acquainted, in early life, when the passions and perceptions are
strong, with persons of every class, and all degrees of talents
and opinions.&nbsp; Thus, asperities are softened, and a
knowledge of men and manners is obtained, which can be acquired
so easily in no other way.&nbsp; England is what it is, by this
early admixture of high and low, rich and poor, one with another;
and it will cease to be old England, free, liberal, and religious
England, when men are taught to consider each other as almost
belonging to a different race of beings from their very
cradles.&nbsp; <i>Every</i> man is an ignorant man who only knows
his <i>own</i> class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right there sir,&rdquo; said the old man,
&ldquo;and all the experience of my long life proves it.&nbsp; I
have seen a thousand times, that if men knew a little more of
each other, half their prejudices on the subjects of religion,
politics, and other causes of division, would vanish away at
once: and these good old schools were great helps in making
youths of all classes know and understand each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another reason for their falling away,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;was their standing still while the world went on.&nbsp;
They taught Latin and Greek, when Latin and Greek were the only
necessary knowledge, and the only passports to <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>wealth and
distinction; and so long as that was the case, all classes were
satisfied with them.&mdash;But the world soon wanted other
knowledge.&mdash;It wanted arithmetic, land-surveying,
engineering, and a thousand other things by which men make money,
and get on in the world.&nbsp; But these things grammar schools
could not or would not teach.&nbsp; So boys were sent to other
places, where wise men, or pretenders to wisdom, professed to
teach all that is necessary for these very enlightened times; and
the old school benches soon became empty.&nbsp; There, grammar
schools were wrong;&mdash;they should have adapted themselves
more to the wants of the times; and then they might have
flourished as of old, to the great benefit of the whole
nation.&nbsp; But I am forgetting your story, and what is more,
forgetting my dinner.&nbsp; Till we meet to-morrow,
farewell!&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<blockquote><p>You call this education, do you not?<br />
Why, &rsquo;tis the forced march of a herd of bullocks<br />

Move on at ease, and pause a while to snatch<br />

That cripples in the rear.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Old

</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Well</span>, sir,&rdquo; said the
old man, smiling, as we met at the appointed spot about one
o&rsquo;clock, &ldquo;now for Hawkshead school!&nbsp; I hope you
have brought all your stock of patience with you, and no appetite
for any thing beyond my little adventures on my first appearance
under the frown of a schoolmaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of appetites,&rdquo; said I, interrupting him,
&ldquo;and seeing what I now see before me, reminds me of a good
joke against myself, which took place when I first knew
Manchester.&nbsp; I was standing upon this bridge, (or rather its
predecessor the old bridge, for the Victoria was not then built,)
at this hour of the day, when suddenly I saw a rush of men,
women, and children upon it, from the Manchester side, which
astonished me not a little.&nbsp; I should think there could not
be fewer than three or four hundred of them: all posting along at
a great pace, with a good deal of anxiety and determination
written on their countenances; and, though they said not a word
to each other, with evidently one common object in view.&nbsp;
They were rather shabbily dressed, and clearly belonged to one
class of society.&nbsp; The imagination immediately conjured up
various startling reasons for this unexpected concourse, such as
a fire, a fight, or a radical meeting.&nbsp; Seeing one solitary
individual who <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>was standing still, like myself, to let the crowd pass
by, and whose countenance seemed to express that he was quite
aware of the cause of this irruption into Salford, I could not
resist the temptation of speaking to him, and
said&mdash;&lsquo;My good friend, where are all these people
going to!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>To their dinners</i>,&rsquo;
said he, quietly and with a grin on his face, that made me
ashamed of my ignorance, and which raises a smile on my cheek
every time I see the same sight, which any man may do who stands
here at one o&rsquo;clock in the day, and sees the workmen of
Manchester hasten home to their dinners in Salford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many a marvellous story,&rdquo; said the old man,
&ldquo;has arisen out of a much less plausible foundation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, to my tale.&mdash;There stood I, an anxious
and trembling little boy, for the first time in my life at the
door of a school.&nbsp; What a large and awful place I thought
it!&nbsp; The very outside frightened me almost beyond endurance,
and then, I thought, what is going on within!&nbsp; My fears were
more than realized on entrance; for the first thing that caught
my eye was the head master himself,&mdash;old Bowman, sitting in
awful state at the head of the school, with a great buzz wig on
his head, and a most formidable ferula lying on the desk before
him.&nbsp; The old oak benches, cut and carved with names, some
of which, insignificant as they then were, are now recorded in
the history of our country, seemed formidable in my eyes, as
compared with the smaller articles of the same kind in my own
home; and the sight of so many boys all gathered together, and
all busy at their own occupations, made my poor little head
almost spin round in confusion.&nbsp; I and my companions were,
of course, as new comers, placed on the lowest form, and had to
wait our turn to be called upon by the master of the lower
school.&nbsp; During that time I had leisure to look around me,
which I did with fear and trembling.&nbsp; At the head of the
school, next to the master, sat Joshua Prince, of whom I had
often heard as the first boy in the school, and a great favourite
with the master.&nbsp; With what a feeling of admiration did I
regard him!&nbsp; He was <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>the son of a miller in the
neighbourhood; but having shown great talents in early life, his
parents determined to give him a good education and send him to
college, in hopes that he might hereafter rise to eminence and
distinction.&nbsp; Nor did he disappoint their
expectations.&nbsp; He carried off the highest honours of his
university, and is now one of the proudest boasts of Hawkshead
school&mdash;thanks to good old archbishop Sandys for having
built and endowed it!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how it is, sir,
but I am as proud of Joshua Prince, and my old school, as if I
had succeeded like Joshua in the world, instead of being what I
am!&nbsp; Well, at last we were called up; and never shall I
forget the anxiety of that moment!&nbsp; Of course, I was at the
bottom of my class, and some boys much older and bigger than
myself were at the top.&nbsp; But I now found the advantage of my
good mother&rsquo;s early care, and soon discovered that I was by
no means the worst scholar among them.&nbsp; At last we came to
spelling:&mdash;&lsquo;Spell <i>kingdom</i>,&rsquo; said the
master to the first boy in the class, in a voice of
thunder.&mdash;&lsquo;K, i, n, d, o, m,&rsquo; said the boy; (and
that boy, you must know, was Tom Hebblethwaite, the very person
whom you saw last summer cutting off the old cock&rsquo;s
tail&mdash;I dare say he was thinking of me at the very
time)&mdash;&lsquo;k, i, n, d, o, m,&rsquo; said Tom:
&lsquo;<i>g</i>,&rsquo; exclaimed I from the bottom of the
class.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; said the master,
&lsquo;stand up!&rsquo;&nbsp; So there was I, raised at once from
the bottom to the top, covered with glory!&nbsp; Tom made room
for me very slowly, but the eye of the master was upon him, and
he gave way.&nbsp; At last the day was over, and, as I thought,
most triumphantly for myself: but I was wofully mistaken!&nbsp;
No sooner had the school broken up, and the masters left for
their own homes, than I saw Tom approaching me in the
school-yard, evidently with no friendly intentions.&nbsp;
&lsquo;So!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;<i>you</i> think yourself, I
dare say, a very fine fellow&mdash;<i>I</i> think you a
mother&rsquo;s darling,&rsquo;&mdash;accompanying this very civil
speech with a box on the ear.&nbsp; My blood was roused at this,
more especially as he sneered at my mother, which to my feelings
was past endurance; <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>and, though scarcely half his size, I turned fiercely
round upon him, and fairly knocked him down!&nbsp; &lsquo;A
battle! a battle!&rsquo; was immediately the cry through the
school-yard; and though half the boys had seemed to be dispersed
for their homes, yet somehow their ears seemed to catch this
<i>delightful</i> sound in a most extraordinary manner, and the
whole school was round us in an incredibly short space of
time.&nbsp; A ring was immediately formed, and due preparations
were made for the contest, according to the laws of that brutal
sport which had prevailed in the school from time
immemorial,&mdash;Joshua Prince being at the head.&nbsp; How I
felt the injustice of that moment! and though I have in some
degree changed my opinion on the subject since, yet I feel much
of that injustice to the present day.&nbsp; My opponent, as I
have said, was almost twice my size and strength, and was
actuated by the worst and most malignant feelings,&mdash;jealousy
and revenge: I had nothing to support me, except a sense of
injustice done me, and a resolution to obtain a character for
manliness which I knew to be essential to a school-boy.&nbsp; I
hoped, therefore, that the bystanders would see the unfairness of
such a contest, and interfere in my behalf.&nbsp; But no; they
were too anxious for what they called &lsquo;the sport,&rsquo; to
give one thought to the merits of the case.&nbsp; I looked
imploringly at Joshua Prince, expecting to see a friend in him at
least; but his eye was inexorable, and, like the rest, he was
eager for the battle.&nbsp; We fought&mdash;he for revenge, I for
honour&mdash;but in despair!&nbsp; As might be expected, I was
severely bruised and beaten, yet I scorned to yield the victory
as long as I was able to resist, and the issue was what neither
of the combatants expected.&nbsp; In his eagerness to secure the
victory, Tom at last struck me when I was on the ground.&nbsp; A
cry of &lsquo;foul, foul,&rsquo; was immediately raised, and I
was taken up from the ground and carried round the yard by my
schoolfellows, and formally proclaimed victor by the whole
school!&nbsp; Tom was forced to admit the justice of this
decision, and slunk away full of shame and disappointment.&nbsp;
So there was I, like many another conqueror, <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>with no other
laurels to show as the fruit of my victory than the injuries
which I had received during the contest.&nbsp; It is true I had
gained the respect of my schoolfellows, but I had paid dearly for
it, both in body and mind.&nbsp; A cloud had been cast over the
sunshine of my first school-day; and what was worse, I had, in
this plight, to face the anger of my father, and the anxious
looks of my poor expecting mother.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">How</span> changed to my eye was
now that mountain road, by which, in the early morning, I had
hastened, full of joy and expectation, to Hawkshead School!&nbsp;
Not that there was any change in reality; for the evening sun
shone as bright in the West over my returning path, as its
morning beams had gilded my eastern track.&nbsp; The cows were
once more lowing in the valleys for the evening milking.&nbsp;
The cuckoos were shouting to each other from glen to glen, as if
they alone had a right to be heard in their own domain.&nbsp; The
lark was whistling a highland fling in the sunbeams, and dancing
to his own merry music in the very centre of the sky.&nbsp; But
all this was lost upon me; for my spirits had sunk to the very
lowest point of despair, and I was thinking, in melancholy
sadness, of the reception I should meet with at home, all black
and bruised as I was; and of the blank which would sadden my poor
mother&rsquo;s face, when she hastened to meet me, and hear my
account of the adventures of the day.&nbsp; My little companions,
to do them justice, sympathized with my feelings; for though they
said little to comfort me, yet they restrained their boyish mirth
within a reasonable compass; and tried to conduct themselves as
if nothing particular had happened&mdash;all that could be
expected from youths like them.&nbsp; I shall never forget my <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>feelings when
Dash rushed out, wagging his tail, and bounding with joy at my
approach, and then, suddenly looking me in the face, turned round
with his tail between his legs, and ran into the house as though
he had been guilty of some serious doggish fault, and expected
instant chastisement!&nbsp; &lsquo;Surely,&rsquo; thought I,
&lsquo;if Dash does not know me, my own mother wont!&rsquo; and
so it proved; for at first sight she hardly recollected who it
was, so changed was I in appearance.&nbsp; But her experience in
the history of schoolboys was much greater than my own; and I saw
at once that she comprehended the whole matter before I had said
a word to her.&nbsp; She looked deadly pale for a moment; but all
she said was,&mdash;&lsquo;My dear boy, are <i>you</i> to blame
for this?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No, mother, I am <span
class="GutSmall">NOT</span>,&rsquo; said I, with a firmness which
I saw at once carried conviction to her heart, and I felt I had
made peace with one of my parents.&nbsp; But the worst, I knew,
and so did my mother, was yet to come.&nbsp; My father was of
another stamp, and viewed matters in another light.&nbsp; He saw,
too, and comprehended at a glance what had happened; but, quite
independent of the right or wrong of the question, his
determination was that all such proceedings should be put down
with the strong hand.&nbsp; I saw, therefore, that I was to be
severely beaten; for my father was not one who did these things
by halves.&nbsp; It was not anger, it was not want of feeling,
that impelled him to this course; it was a strong, though in this
case surely a mistaken, sense of duty.&nbsp; My mother and I,
both knowing his character and feelings, knew it was in vain to
remonstrate; so I stood with terror, and my poor mother stood as
pale as death, prepared for the worst.&nbsp; Just at that moment,
and when the feelings of all the party, my father&rsquo;s
included, were almost past endurance, the door flew open with
some violence, and <span class="smcap">Joshua Prince</span> stood
in the middle of the room!&nbsp; &lsquo;Dont strike the
boy,&rsquo; said he, in a firm voice that seemed resolved to be
listened to, &lsquo;dont strike the boy, for he does not deserve
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Had an angel from heaven appeared to us at that
moment, my mother and I could not have been more <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>delighted,
nor hardly more startled than we at first were at his most
unexpected and most timely appearance; and in truth, I believe my
father was not the least relieved of the whole party.&nbsp; The
uplifted rod dropped by his side, as it were by instinct; and he
looked at Joshua with an expression of respect which led me to
hope that the crisis of my fate was past.&nbsp; In the
neighbourhood of large grammar schools there is always much
interest felt in their proceedings among those inhabitants of the
district who have little or no immediate connexion with
them.&nbsp; They are proud of the success of the best
scholars&mdash;even those who are no scholars whatever
themselves&mdash;and the head boy of a school is always spoken of
with great respect, especially by those who are in any way
connected with the place, either through their children or their
own early education.&nbsp; My father, therefore, had a strong
feeling of almost reverence for Joshua Prince, though he had
hardly ever seen him before; and would have at once obeyed him,
even in a matter less agreeable to his feelings.&nbsp; The rod,
therefore, at once fell idly to his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I thought it possible,&rsquo; continued <span
class="smcap">Joshua</span>, &lsquo;that you might beat him, and
so I came to tell you that he does not deserve it.&nbsp; He was
ill-used by Tom Hebblethwaite, and he fought like a man.&nbsp;
Send him to school to-morrow, and I will see that he comes by no
harm&mdash;good night!&rsquo;&mdash;and Joshua disappeared in the
gloom.&nbsp; Now, sir, you may talk of great and generous
actions, but I do not think you will easily mention one which, as
far as it goes, will surpass this of <span class="smcap">Joshua
Prince</span>.&nbsp; You will recollect that he was, after all,
but a boy; young and thoughtless; delighted with the battle, and
pleased that he had done justice to the conqueror, if such I
could be called.&nbsp; He lived down the valley towards Newby
Bridge, nearly four miles from school, and in almost an opposite
direction to Yewdale.&nbsp; Yet all at once, when more than half
way home, and with the prospect of supper before a hungry boy
brightening as he goes, it flashes across his mind that I may
possibly be chastised undeservedly for the day&rsquo;s
occurrences, and he hesitates not a <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>moment as to what steps he should
take.&nbsp; He turns aside across hill and valley, bog and
stream, where there is no footpath even for the goat, forgets his
supper and his evening fishing-rod, and all to save a little boy
whom he never saw before from a beating which, from its frequency
at school, and from the way in which he had encouraged the
battle, he might have been expected to care very little
about.&nbsp; Nor <i>was</i> it the beating that he cared
about.&nbsp; It was its <i>injustice</i> that dwelt upon his
mind.&nbsp; The brave have an instinctive admiration of bravery;
and he did not like to think that the little boy should be
ill-used, or rather misunderstood, who had shown such firmness
and courage in the school-yard.&nbsp; These were Joshua&rsquo;s
motives; and verily he had his reward.&nbsp; The gratitude
towards him of our whole family, including my sister, (of whom I
shall speak by and by,) was such that there was nothing that we
would not have done for his sake.&nbsp; Yet he never seemed to
expect any thing; or to show that he thought himself to have done
any thing extraordinary.&nbsp; He paid me very little attention
at school; none, in fact, beyond what he showed to most of the
younger boys; except that when any injury was attempted towards
me by any of those who were stronger than myself, he was always
ready to see justice done me.&nbsp; Favouritism he scrupulously
avoided.&nbsp; An acquaintance between us thus commenced, which
ripened almost into friendship as I grew older, and before he
left us for college.&nbsp; But, what is most remarkable, his
kindness towards me seemed to increase, rather than diminish, by
absence.&nbsp; Many a kind message of advice did he send me by
fellow-pupils while I remained at school; and he has more than
once visited me in my quiet dwelling in Salford, though he has
had an earl&rsquo;s son under his care; and has brought
<i>him</i> to see the ways of Manchester, and taught him to
sympathize with its toiling population.&nbsp; <i>These</i>, sir,
are the links, which bind all the parts of English society
together, stronger than chains of brass!&nbsp; These good old
schools are like rivets which run through the whole body politic;
hence it was that the earl&rsquo;s son, <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>Joshua
Prince, and your humble servant, became fast friends for
life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man&rsquo;s face glowed as he said this, with a
feeling which showed that he was a patriot to the back
bone.&nbsp; His poverty, and his age, in the ardour of the
moment, were quite forgotten.&mdash;His school-days were as fresh
on his mind as if they had hardly yet passed away; and I felt
thankful to Providence as I experienced how deeply he has infused
happiness into natures and conditions where the hasty observer
might scarcely be able to observe a trace of it.</p>
<p>He continued&mdash;&ldquo;I will not detain you longer with
the history of my school-days; I have something far more
important, and I hope, more interesting to speak of,&mdash;my
first religious impressions.&nbsp; But I cannot help just
mentioning one early companion who was soon lost to us all, but
whose character made a deep impression upon myself and many of my
school-fellows.&nbsp; He was but the son of a poor labourer, but
showed an early talent for poetry, and produced some pieces of
very great merit, which I wish I could recollect now, as they
would be a comfort to me in my solitary hours; but he sank, in
decline, to an early grave; and all his verses, I fear, died with
him; for though many of his poems were committed by his
school-fellows to memory, yet none have recorded any of them in
writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your story,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;reminds me of an
exactly similar case, (and doubtless there are hundreds such,)
which happened nearly thirty years ago, at a school very like
your own,&mdash;that of Richmond, in Yorkshire.&nbsp; Poor <span
class="smcap">Herbert Knowles</span> was, like your young
companion, taken from one of the lowest stations in life, and
sent by kind friends to Richmond school, with the intention of
his being afterwards removed to college.&nbsp; But the hand of
death was upon him.&nbsp; He was of a gentle and pious mind, and
of a sickly frame.&nbsp; He knew that his days were fast drawing
to a close, and a few weeks before he died he wrote the following
verses at night in Richmond Church-yard, which show the way in
which he looked <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>death in the face, and the faith and hope which pointed
beyond the grave.&nbsp; As you are fond of poetry, I will repeat
the verses to you, and they may perhaps somewhat console you for
the loss of your friend&rsquo;s:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This <i>is</i> poetry,&rdquo; exclaimed the old man,
when I had finished reciting the above beautiful
lines,&mdash;&ldquo;and piety as well as poetry.&nbsp; The youth
who, with his own death full in view, could give utterance to
such holy thoughts, and in the darkness of the night, with the
dead of old lying around him and beneath his feet, must surely be
gone to heaven!&rdquo;</p>

in those days<br />
When this low pile a Gospel Teacher knew,<br />
Whose good works form&rsquo;d an endless retinue:<br />

Such as the heaven-taught skill of Herbert drew;<br />
And tender Goldsmith crown&rsquo;d with deathless praise!</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Wordsworth</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I <span class="GutSmall">AM</span> now,&rdquo; the old
man continued, &ldquo;approaching the most important period of my
life.&nbsp; My school-days glided away peaceably, and in some
measure, profitably.&nbsp; I was quite able and willing to learn
every thing required of me by my masters, and had plenty of time
to spare to follow all those various sports and amusements which
occupy the time and thoughts of rustic lads in mountain
regions.&nbsp; Bird-nesting, fishing, wrestling, hunting, came
each in their turn with the change of the seasons; and I was
growing up a hale, strong youth, happy in my home, and in good
humour with myself and all the world: and, sir, I cannot help
remarking, by the way, that good humour, like charity,
&lsquo;begins at home;&rsquo; for I never knew any one yet who
was dissatisfied and out of sorts with persons or things around
him, who had not first quarrelled with himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really think there is much truth in that remark of
yours,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it there is,&rdquo; he continued.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, my happiness at that period of my life might be
said, as far as human happiness could be,&mdash;to be
perfect.&nbsp; But yet the religious state of my mind was not
quite satisfactory.&nbsp; I had learned, and not only well
remembered, but understood, every thing with regard to religion
which <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>was
taught us at school; and that, believe me, was not little.&nbsp;
We were taught to repeat our Catechism, with Archbishop
Wake&rsquo;s explanation of it, every week.&nbsp; We read the
Bible as a school-book, till we could almost repeat it from
beginning to end; and every story in it was as familiar to my
mind as the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer.&nbsp; I know many have a strong
objection to the use of the Bible as a school-book, but I confess
I am not among the number.&nbsp; On the contrary, I hold that
familiarity with the Scriptures in childhood is the only way in
which a knowledge of them can be so deeply impressed upon the
memory, as that the passages which we want shall always be at
hand to serve us at every turn.&nbsp; As we get older we may
understand what we read better, but we do not remember it so
clearly or so long.&nbsp; What I read <i>now</i>, slips away
almost as soon as the book is laid down; but what I learned
<i>then</i>, is as fresh in my memory as my school-day sports, or
my first companions in life.&nbsp; I know it is objected, that an
early familiarity with the Scriptures is apt to bring them into
contempt, and that we are liable to attach false meanings to
passages, which sometimes cling to us through the rest of our
lives.&nbsp; But surely, if this be the effect, the fault is
rather in those who put the Scriptures into our hands, than in
our early youth, in which we first begin to read them.&nbsp; I
only know that I learned to reverence even the outside of the
book of <span class="smcap">God</span>&rsquo;s Word from my poor
mother&rsquo;s reverent manner of using it.&nbsp; She never
opened the volume without an expression of countenance which
showed that she felt herself at that moment to be in the more
immediate presence of her Maker; and I still look upon the corner
in which it was always put aside, and call to mind its black
cover, with her horn spectacles resting upon it, with as much
respect as the Roman Catholic is said to regard the image of his
saint.&nbsp; Mine, however, is no superstitious reverence, but a
pious regard for the Word of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and
<i>her</i> from whose lips I was first taught it; and, sir, when
I read my Bible now, which I hope I do not much neglect, I
combine pleasure as well as well as profit,&mdash;it <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>brings back
to me the happy recollections of my youth, as well as affords the
consolations of old age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I quite agree with you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;as to the
advantages of an early acquaintance with the Bible.&nbsp; Whether
it should be made a school-book or not, depends entirely upon the
capabilities and sound principles of the teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are right,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but mine
were like the &lsquo;words of king Lemuel, which his mother
taught him:&rsquo; and old Bowman, to do him justice, drilled the
somewhat dry catechism of the good Archbishop pretty soundly into
my memory.&nbsp; Yet, as far as I can recollect, I had not at
that time any very distinct notions of the value of the Gospel,
as distinct from natural religion, and the obvious duty of doing
as I was taught.&nbsp; I knew all the <i>facts</i> of
Christianity perfectly.&nbsp; I could tell all the events of our
<span class="smcap">Saviour</span>&rsquo;s life, and enumerate
accurately every doctrine taught by Himself and His
apostles.&nbsp; I knew the necessity of unity in the Catholic
Church, and understood the Creeds by which that unity was
intended to be secured.&nbsp; But I did not see how these things
applied to myself, as guides for my own thoughts and
actions.&nbsp; My real religion, I believe, as far as I can call
back my thoughts at this distance of time, consisted a good deal
in fear, both of <span class="smcap">God</span> and man.&nbsp; My
father, as I have said, was a strict disciplinarian; his word was
law: and my fear of <span class="smcap">God</span>, I cannot help
thinking, arose almost naturally out of the situation in which
nature had placed me.&nbsp; In very early life,&mdash;as far back
as I can recollect anything,&mdash;I underwent great alarm from
what is a common occurrence in that mountain range&mdash;a
terrific thunder storm.&nbsp; The effect of the lightning in that
land of hill and valley, is very striking; and was never more so
than on that well-remembered day!&nbsp; Sometimes it seemed to
dance in wanton playfulness on the side of the mountain, and
sometimes to split it from the top to the bottom.&nbsp; Then the
echoing thunder ran up one valley and down another in that land
of seams and ridges, coming back again to the place which it had
left, with a voice hardly weakened by its circuit; and there,
joining <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>a
new and equally loud report, the bellowing became as confused and
endless as it was startling.&nbsp; Then came the thunder-shower,
not in drops of rain, but solid sheets of water.&nbsp; The white
cataracts began foaming and rushing down the side of every hill,
and gushing out of every opening in the valleys, till they
swelled our little stream that winds beneath the house into a
mighty and irresistible torrent, sweeping every thing before it
towards the lake with rapid and resistless fury.&nbsp; But what
most impressed my mind at the moment, was to see a poor innocent
sheep, as well known to me by face as Dash himself, hurled down
by the current, and bleating piteously, but in vain, for
help!&nbsp; This scene, and scenes like these, made a deep
impression on my mind; and I began to entertain a constant and
solemn feeling of the continual presence and irresistible power
of <span class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; This thought was
uppermost in my mind from morning till night; in the fields and
on my bed.&nbsp; It was doubtless valuable to me as a guide to
duty, but it gave a gloomy turn to my thoughts which was
inconsistent with the buoyant feelings of youth, and, as I have
since discovered, not in harmony with the true spirit of the
Gospel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I must now introduce to you another member of our family,
to whom I have as yet hardly alluded, for many painful reasons,
but whose history now begins to be blended with mine in a manner
which renders all farther avoidance of her tale impossible.&nbsp;
I refer to my poor sister Martha!&nbsp; She was several years
older than myself; and at the time I am now speaking of, had
arrived at woman&rsquo;s estate.&nbsp; She was a splendid
specimen of a fine well-grown mountain girl, except that she was
rather paler than exactly suits the taste of the hardy
mountaineer; her paleness, however, arose, I believe, not from
any delicacy of frame, but from habitual thoughtfulness.&nbsp;
How she was admired and sought after by the shy rustics of the
neighbourhood! and, above all, how she was beloved by
myself!&nbsp; Alas!&mdash;in the language of a friend of mine,
who, though unknown to fame, is a true poet&mdash;at that period
of her short life,</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>&lsquo;The liquid lustre of her
eye<br />
Had ne&rsquo;er been dimm&rsquo;d by fond hopes blighted;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The halo of serenity<br />
Still kept her marble forehead lighted!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Her kindness to me seemed to arise from her having
united the feelings of a sister and a mother towards me.&nbsp;
She was so much older than myself as to be justified in using, as
she sometimes did, the language of authority; and yet not so far
removed from me in years, but that she could look upon me as a
brother, and that I could treat her (as I too often did) with at
least a brother&rsquo;s freedom.&nbsp; Thus, as I grew older, and
my mind expanded from the instruction I received at Hawkshead, I
became more and more to be regarded by her as a companion and
less as a child.&nbsp; Thus she, who had been a check upon me and
a teacher, now began at times to learn something from me, of
which you may well suppose that I was very proud; whilst I was
daily growing in admiration of her industry, piety, and
patience.&nbsp; She assisted her mother in all the female labours
of the house and the little farm, and yet always kept herself as
neat and nice as if she had nothing else to do.&nbsp; All at
once, her manner began to change.&nbsp; Instead of her constant
cheerfulness, she became anxious and absent, though by no means
fretful or impatient.&nbsp; Her paleness visibly increased, and
her step grew less elastic and light.&nbsp; She occasionally
absented herself from home without mentioning where she had been,
or asking me, as she used formerly to do, to accompany her.&nbsp;
This was noticed by myself long before it was perceived, or at
least mentioned, by either my father or my mother; for I began to
entertain a jealous feeling that her affections were, from some
cause or other, weakening towards me; yet, as she never mentioned
the subject herself, a feeling of pride or obstinacy checked me
from being the first to seek an explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We stood in this situation with regard to each other
just at the time when I was approaching fourteen years of age,
and a rumour ran through the country that the Bishop was about to
visit Ulverston for the purpose of <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>holding a Confirmation.&nbsp; This,
as you may suppose, caused a great sensation among the youths of
my age in that retired neighbourhood, for visitations were not so
frequent then as they fortunately are now, though surely if they
were still more frequent, it would be a great blessing to the
country.&nbsp; For this solemn rite it was necessary that I
should be prepared.&nbsp; But we were a long way from our parish
church of Seathwaite, and we had been in the habit, for nearness,
of frequenting Torver chapel, though not resident in the
district.&nbsp; I confess I looked forward to this preparation
with a mixed feeling of alarm and curiosity.&nbsp; I was alarmed
for fear that I should be found sadly deficient in the
information necessary to justify me in appearing before the
Bishop; and I was curious to know what steps my parents proposed
to take to have me trained for the proper participation in this
solemn rite.&nbsp; I confess that a willingness to postpone what
I considered a somewhat evil day prevented me from asking any
questions on this subject.&nbsp; At last I overheard a
conversation between my parents one night after we had retired to
rest (for our rooms were so near, and the doors and walls so full
of chinks, that everything that passed was distinctly heard from
one room to another) which led me to expect that the very day
after, I was to be put in a train for preparation; but how, I had
no means of gathering.&nbsp; Accordingly, after the usual
morning&rsquo;s work of the farm was over, my father (which was
very unusual with him) went to his room to put on his
Sunday&rsquo;s clothes; and my mother, with a pleased yet anxious
expression on her countenance, directed me to do the same.&nbsp;
I asked no questions, for the reason I have just mentioned, but
quietly obeyed.&nbsp; We were soon on the way together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a fine bright autumn morning, when we set off on
this remarkable pilgrimage; I feeling that nothing but a most
important matter could have induced my father to lose a
day&rsquo;s work at this season of the year; and my father and
mother observing a perfect silence, both apparently wrapped up in
their own thoughts.&nbsp; <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>Our way lay by a cart-track that led
right up to the top of <span class="smcap">Walna Scar</span>, a
fine bold cliff, which I dare say you have climbed, for
sight-seers find it a noble point for a prospect on their way
between <span class="smcap">Coniston</span> and <span
class="smcap">Seathwaite</span>.&nbsp; It was the time of the
year when the farmers in that country cut their turf for their
winter stock of firing, and all the able-bodied population are
then to be found assembled at their work on the hills.&nbsp; I
felt assured therefore, that my parents were seeking some
labourer in the place where he was sure, at that season, to be
found; but how this could possibly concern me, I could not
conjecture.&nbsp; At last, after a toilsome climb, we reached to
the top of <span class="smcap">Walna</span>; and there lay before
us a prospect, such as the eye can command, I should think, in
few other regions of the globe!&nbsp; Mountains of all shapes and
sizes lay tossed in wild confusion around us, like the billows of
a stormy sea!&nbsp; Lakes sparkled at our feet like
looking-glasses for the giants; while the mighty western ocean
bounded almost half the prospect round, as with a silver
girdle.&nbsp; But this prospect had nothing to do with our visit
here; nor I believe did it once cross the mind of either my
father or my mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were anxiously looking out among the groups of
turf-getters with which the top of the hill was dotted, for some
one who was apparently the object of this unusual visit.&nbsp; As
we went along, the labourers stopped to speak and to gaze, for a
country man in a holiday dress at that busy season, was to them a
rare sight.&nbsp; A few enquiries directed my father to the
object of his search: and we soon approached a group of labourers
who seemed so intent upon their work, that we stood close to them
before we were observed.&nbsp; They differed little from the
little bands that were toiling around them, except that the eye
at once detected that they were all of one family.&nbsp; There
were four able-bodied men who wheeled the turf, when cut, in
barrows, to the ground where they were spread out to dry, and
three girls, somewhat younger, who laid them flat on the ground
for that purpose.&nbsp; The turf-cutter was evidently the father
of all the rest.&nbsp; He <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>was a short and stout man, with ruddy
cheeks, and hair as white as snow.&nbsp; He was obviously very
far advanced in years, but as active in his occupation as if he
had been a much younger man.&nbsp; He had on a check shirt, and a
coarse blue frock trimmed with black horn buttons, something like
the dress of a charity boy at Chetham&rsquo;s Hospital, and not
very unlike a parson&rsquo;s cassock.&nbsp; He was so intent upon
his work that he did not perceive our approach till my father
spoke to him, when the little old man turned suddenly round, with
his spade uplifted in the air, as if he was impatient of being
interrupted in his labour.&nbsp; To my surprise, my father
immediately took off his hat, and my mother made a curtsey,
actions so unusual that I began to feel an involuntary respect
for him to whom such honours were paid.&nbsp; He returned the
salute with a friendly bow and smile which showed that such
attentions were not new to him: and my father taking me by the
hand said, almost in the words of Scripture, &lsquo;Sir, this is
our son of whom I spake unto you.&rsquo;&nbsp; The old man
stepped forward, and laid his hand on my head, and said, with an
expression of countenance which I shall never
forget&mdash;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">God</span> be gracious
unto thee, my son!&rsquo;&nbsp; Had the hand of a patriarch of
old been then upon me, it could not have affected me more.&nbsp;
It was &lsquo;<span class="smcap">Wonderful Walker</span>;&rsquo;
did you ever hear, sir, of Wonderful Walker?&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You, Sir, know that in a
neighbouring vale<br />
A Priest abides before whose life such doubts<br />
Fall to the ground; whose gifts of nature lie<br />
Retired from notice. . . .<br />
In this one man is shown a temperance proof<br />
Against all trials; industry severe<br />
And constant as the motion of the day. . . .<br />
Preaching, administering, in every work<br />
Of his sublime vocation, in the walks<br />
Of worldly intercourse between man and man,<br />
And in his humble dwelling, he appears<br />
A labourer, with moral virtue girt,<br />
With spiritual graces, like a glory, crown&rsquo;d.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Doubt can be none,&rdquo; the Pastor said,
&ldquo;for whom<br />
This portraiture is sketch&rsquo;d.&nbsp; The great, the good,<br
/>
The well-belov&rsquo;d, the fortunate, the wise,<br />
These titles emperors and chiefs have borne,<br />
Honour assumed or given: and him, the <span
class="smcap">Wonderful</span>,<br />
Our simple shepherds, speaking from the heart,<br />
Deservedly have styled.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span

</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Hear</span> of Wonderful
Walker?&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to be sure I have! and have
honoured and revered his memory as one of the bright lights of
the Church, shining in a dark age, and in a remote corner of the
world, where it might have been feared that light would hardly
have extended.&nbsp; Why, my good friend, I once walked to the
quiet and retired village of Seathwaite that I might make a
pilgrimage to his grave; and though I have gazed upon the tombs
and monuments of many of the most renowned heroes and sages of
days gone by, none of them filled my mind with such deep
sensations of awe and reverence as the quiet and unpretending
tomb of Robert Walker!&nbsp; I yet see the inscription as freshly
as if I had read it yesterday&mdash;the villagers point it out
with pride and pleasure, as an honour to their rustic
church-yard, and preserve it from all profanation, as a treasure
above all price.&nbsp; How <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>humble is the inscription engraved on
that modest tombstone!&nbsp; What a couple of saints are there
recorded, reposing in peace and union after a long life of pious
usefulness, and awaiting the sound of the archangel&rsquo;s
trumpet with a faith as firm as their sleep is tranquil!&nbsp;
Thus runs the record:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In memory of the Reverend Robert
Walker, who died the 25th of June, 1802, in the 93rd year of his
age, and 67th of his curacy at Seathwaite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Also, of Anne his wife, who died the 28th of
January, in the 92nd year of her age.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Truly were they &lsquo;lovely in their lives, and in
death not divided.&rsquo;&nbsp; How I envy you, my friend, to
have been taught by the honest voice, and to have gazed on the
honest face of Robert Walker!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly, sir, you are quite enthusiastic about my old
pastor, and I suspect you have read the poet Wordsworth&rsquo;s
delightful sketch of his character, with the materials for which
he was supplied by some of his surviving descendants; if not, I
recommend you to lose no time in doing so.&nbsp; My recollections
of him are of a humbler kind, but perhaps not less interesting;
to me he has been more than a father.&nbsp; His divine words yet
live in my memory&mdash;I wish I had always followed his good
advice, and good example!</p>
<p>&ldquo;His habits, as you know, were quite upon a level with
the plain and homely rustics of the village.&nbsp; He lived as
they lived, and worked as they worked.&nbsp; But he lost no
spiritual influence, or even worldly respect by this; on the
contrary, by excelling them all in those pursuits of which they
could judge, he gained credit among them for being always right
in matters wherein they were less informed.&nbsp; I believe the
clergy, by their too frequent ignorance of, or contempt for,
common things, often lose an influence among the uneducated,
which all their knowledge of divinity can never make amends
for.&nbsp; Walker was the best shepherd on the mountains, and was
not the less qualified thereby for being the spiritual shepherd
of his people.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>&ldquo;You remind me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;of a good
old parson of Buttermere, who was really a learned and sound
divine, but was most esteemed by his flock as being the best
wrestler in all the country side!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds ridiculous enough,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;but what good thing is there which does not become
ridiculous in its excess?&nbsp; Good Mr. Walker, however, was of
a different stamp.&nbsp; He was at peace with himself and all the
world.&nbsp; He ne&rsquo;er had changed nor wished to change his
place.&nbsp; Where he was born, there he lived, and there he
died.&nbsp; He baptized, married and buried, almost every
individual of at least two generations in his parish; and where
he laid them in their last resting-place, there he lay down
himself, waiting his final reward.&nbsp; I have myself always
much respect for a dead body, knowing that it shall live for
ever; and I always think that he who cares little for the bodies
of them that sleep in <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, is often
little better than an infidel.&nbsp; It is not the soul only that
is immortal, the body is immortal also!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir, to my tale.&nbsp; My father
continued&mdash;&lsquo;Hearing that a confirmation is about to be
held, we are anxious to put this our boy under the care of your
Reverence, that he may be duly prepared.&nbsp; We think, from
what his master, Mr. Bowman, says of him, that he is a good
scholar, and well-informed in matters of religion; we know that
he is a tolerably good boy at home,&rsquo; (here my father spoke
with a half-smile on his face, as if unwilling to allow so much
in my favour in my presence; and indeed, though much delighted,
for I had never heard him say so much good of me before, I fear
the effect was in some degree to feed my vanity:)
&lsquo;<i>generally speaking</i>,&rsquo; my father continued,
with an emphasis on the phrase, &lsquo;<i>generally speaking</i>
his conduct is very fair.&nbsp; But we know that you always wish
to prepare the young of your own parish for confirmation; and so
we have brought him to you that you may give us your advice as to
what he is to do to prepare himself, and you may depend upon it
that we will see that it is done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Thank you, my good friend,&rsquo; said the
Pastor, <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>highly delighted, &lsquo;thank you!&nbsp; You have done
what all parents ought, but not more than I expected from
you.&nbsp; I remember well, when I prepared you,&mdash;now forty
years ago,&mdash;when I prepared <i>you</i> for the same solemn
rite, I remember I told you not to forget to bring up your
children in the way they should go, and thankful to <span
class="smcap">God</span> am I, that the seed sown so long since
has lived in your hearts, and has shot up at the proper time as
fresh as if it had been sown last spring!&nbsp; Truly the seeds
of grace are as immortal as the seeds of nature.&nbsp; See you
that violet?&rsquo; said he, pointing to a little simple pansy
that was bending its graceful flower close to the spot on which
the old man stood,&mdash;&lsquo;look at it, and think, how came
it there?&nbsp; Last autumn, this spot was covered with
bog-earth, which had probably rested on this bleak and barren
moor ever since the deluge.&nbsp; It was disturbed last year by
the spade of the turf-getter, and now, this beautiful little
flower has sprung up in this place!&nbsp; For ages and ages its
seed must have remained embedded in this sour and barren bog;
yet, once disturbed by the hand of man, it springs up fresh and
lively, to show that <span class="smcap">God</span> can keep
alive what to the eye of man may seem to perish, and can deck
with grace and beauty even the most unpromising spots of
creation!&nbsp; So be it with Thy <span
class="GutSmall">WORD</span>,&rsquo; said he, looking devoutly
upwards.&nbsp; Now, I had observed the pansy growing on the
portions of heath which had been moved by the spade a thousand
times, yet never till now did I think that such a moral could be
drawn from so simple a fact.&nbsp; And, sir, I believe that there
is <i>no</i> fact, in nature or in art, from which a devout and
observant mind may not learn similar lessons of devotion.&nbsp; I
never see a violet now, that I do not think on Robert Walker, and
the power of the grace of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man paused a little, and then continued:
&lsquo;My boy,&rsquo; said the Pastor, addressing himself to me,
&lsquo;are you ready to learn?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;As ready as
you to teach,&rsquo; said I, firmly but respectfully.&nbsp; I
have often thought since, that such a reply might, in the ears of
some pastors, have sounded something like a reproach; but in the
ears of Robert <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>Walker, whose &lsquo;aptness to teach&rsquo; was as well
known as his other good qualities, it was a most agreeable
answer.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sharp and ready, I see,&rsquo; said he,
turning to my father with a smile; &lsquo;but most of
Bowman&rsquo;s lads are pretty well trained.&nbsp; I wish you to
come to my church next Sunday morning, when I propose to commence
a course of lectures to the candidates for confirmation; and I
trust your parents will accompany you.&nbsp; They must present
you in the temple, as Joseph and Mary did their Holy Child.&nbsp;
I shall expect you all to &ldquo;dine with me at noon,&rdquo;
with the rest of the parish.&rsquo;&nbsp; This must sound in your
ears as a large invitation from a poor pastor (his income was not
more than &pound;20 a year) to a whole parish.&nbsp; But, sir, it
is no exaggeration; every Sunday did this good man keep open
house to his flock, and all were welcome who chose to partake of
his boiled beef or mutton, and a bason of broth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this point in our conversation a young man joined
our party, whom I had for some time observed strolling about, and
occasionally addressing some of the various parties engaged in
cutting turf on the fell.&nbsp; He was good looking, and dressed
in the prevailing fashion of the time, that is, very much as I am
at present, for my outward man has stood still in its attire for
the last forty years.&nbsp; It was evident that he was no native
of the north, and might be one of those <i>Lakers</i>, who, in
that early period, though not in such numbers as at present,
visited the lakes during the summer season, to enjoy the beauties
of their scenery, and imbibe health and strength from the pure
breath of their mountain breezes.&nbsp; He evidently eyed our
Reverend friend with much curiosity; and respectfully touching
his hat, said with a smile, &lsquo;Your outward attire, father,
has in my eyes a somewhat primitive appearance.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr.
Walker, if he felt the sneer, did not seem to notice it, but
replied with plain simplicity, &lsquo;I flatter myself, sir, that
my dress is such as at once becomes my character, and bespeaks my
office.&nbsp; It is coarse in its texture, for the materials of
it were spun by my own hand; but its form is such as has been
handed <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>down from time immemorial as belonging to the
priest&rsquo;s office, and I see no reason, sir, why the
priest&rsquo;s vesture should not be as unchangeable as his
creed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Unchangeable! venerable sir, <i>what</i> is
unchangeable?&nbsp; Is not the human mind, in our days, gradually
but irresistibly marching onwards, from the darkness of ignorance
to the broad daylight of liberty and knowledge?&nbsp; Is not this
an age of new light?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo;
said the priest, &ldquo;but if my creed be true, the last new
light from <i>heaven</i> came in the days of our <span
class="smcap">Saviour</span>&mdash;any new light <i>since</i>
then, must, I fear, have a different origin!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stranger did not seem disposed to pursue the
conversation further, but, slightly touching his hat, took his
leave.&nbsp; We also paid our parting respects to the pastor, and
commenced our journey home.&nbsp; The stranger joined us before
we had advanced far on our return, and certainly we found him a
most intelligent and agreeable companion.&nbsp; He had seen much
of foreign countries, and mentioned many circumstances with
regard to them and their customs, which made a deep impression on
my youthful imagination.&nbsp; He accompanied us to the door of
our house, which was opened by my sister; and, much to my
surprise, she received him with an expression of countenance, and
a conscious blush on her cheek, which showed that it was not the
first time that they had met.&nbsp; My curiosity was excited, and
I resolved, if possible, to find out the stranger&rsquo;s history
and occupation.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<blockquote><p>Would that our scrupulous sires had dared to
leave<br />
Less scanty measure of those graceful rites<br />
And usages, whose due return invites<br />
A stir of mind too natural to deceive;<br />

A crown of hope!&nbsp; I dread the boasted lights<br />
That all too often are but fiery blights,<br />
Killing the bud o&rsquo;er which in vain we grieve.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Wordsworth</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid sir,&rdquo; continued the old man, as we
resumed our walk and our conversation, &ldquo;that you will begin
to think my tale of things gone by both tiresome and
unprofitable.&nbsp; To me it is interesting, because, as I tell
my story, my mind goes back to the days of my youth, and the
early feelings, both of joy and sorrow, return to my heart as my
narrative calls them up, almost as freshly as when the scenes
were acting before my eyes.&nbsp; But that the task is
unprofitable, I cannot help sometimes confessing to myself,
however pleasing it may be to my feelings.&nbsp; Walker, and all
that concerned him, are gone to the grave.&nbsp; The world has
marched on with wonderful strides since his day; his clumsy
spinning wheel is now rendered useless by machinery; and even in
his own little vale, a child&rsquo;s hand can, in one short week,
produce a greater quantity and a much finer quality of well spun
yarn than he, poor man, twisted together during the long and
laborious years of his whole life!&nbsp; Why, then, should one
look to him, and not to that child, as a model?&nbsp; I feel that
it would be absurd to take the latter rather than the former as
an example, yet I confess I cannot assign the reason for it: and
thus it is, that when I am told that the present age is in
advance of the last, and ought rather to be my guide than the
ways of antiquity, I am <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>often driven into a difficulty,
though never convinced;&mdash;what think you of the
matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your difficulty,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;seems to arise
from confounding progress in arts and sciences with progress in
moral and mental power.&nbsp; The one is as different from the
other as possible, nor does the existence of the one at all imply
the presence of the other.&nbsp; The child you have referred to
as being able to spin so much better than Walker,&mdash;could it
reason like Walker? would it act and feel like him?&mdash;By no
means; and so neither may an age, distinguished for mechanical
progress, excel one of darkness with regard to such matters, and
yet devoted to pursuits and studies which call forth the powers
of the mind, and exercise the best qualities of the heart.&nbsp;
Shakspere and Milton might have made sorry cotton-spinners; no
farmer now would plough, like Elisha, with twelve yoke of oxen
before him, yet where is the farmer who would surpass the prophet
in zeal, and eloquence, and devotion to his Master&rsquo;s
service?&nbsp; Never fear, then, my friend, that the example of
good Mr. Walker can grow old and useless; we can easily cut
better peats than he did by the help of better tools, but when
shall we surpass him in shrewd observation of the face of nature,
in industry, in devotion to <span class="smcap">God</span>, in
kindness and good-will to man!&nbsp; Hear what is said of him by
a great-grandson, who may well be prouder of being a descendant
of Robert Walker, than if he had come of the purest blood in
Europe:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;His house was a nursery of
virtue.&nbsp; All the inmates were industrious, and cleanly, and
happy.&nbsp; Sobriety, neatness, quietness, characterized the
whole family.&nbsp; No railings, no idleness, no indulgence of
passion were permitted.&nbsp; Every child, however young, had its
appointed engagements; every hand was busy.&nbsp; Knitting,
spinning, reading, writing, mending clothes, making shoes, were
by the different children constantly performed.&nbsp; The father
himself sitting amongst them and guiding their thoughts, was
engaged in the same operations.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He sat up late and rose early; when the family
were at rest, he retired to a little room which he had built on
the roof of his house.&nbsp; He had slated it, and fitted it up
with shelves for his books, his stock of cloth, wearing apparel,
and his utensils.&nbsp; There many a cold winter&rsquo;s night,
without fire, while the roof <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>was glazed with ice, did he remain
reading or writing till the day dawned.&nbsp; He taught the
children in the chapel, for there was no school house.&nbsp; Yet
in that cold damp place he never had a fire.&nbsp; He used to
send the children in parties either to his own fire at home, or
make them run up the mountain&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It may be further mentioned, that he was a
passionate admirer of nature; she was his mother, and he was a
dutiful child.&nbsp; While engaged on the mountains, it was his
greatest pleasure to view the rising sun; and in tranquil
evenings, as it slided behind the hills, he blessed its
departure.&nbsp; He was skilled in fossils and plants; a constant
observer of the stars and winds.&nbsp; The atmosphere was his
delight: he made many experiments on its nature and
properties.&nbsp; In summer, he used to gather a multitude of
flies and insects, and, by his entertaining descriptions, amuse
and instruct his children.&nbsp; They shared all his daily
employments, and derived many sentiments of love and benevolence
from his observations on the works and productions of
nature.&nbsp; Whether they were following him in the field or
surrounding him in school, he took every opportunity of storing
their minds with useful information.&mdash;Nor was the circle of
his influence confined to Seathwaite.&nbsp; Many a distant mother
has told her child of Mr. Walker, and begged him to be as good a
man.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Once, when I was very young, I had the pleasure
of seeing and hearing that venerable old man in his 90th year,
and even then, the calmness, the force, the perspicuity of his
sermon, sanctified and adorned by the wisdom of grey hairs, and
the authority of virtue had such an effect upon my mind, that I
never see a hoary-headed clergyman without thinking of Mr.
Walker.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He allowed no dissenter or methodist to
interfere in the instruction of the souls committed to his care:
and so successful were his exertions, that he had not one
dissenter of any denomination whatever in the whole
parish.&mdash;Though he avoided all religious controversies, yet
when age had silvered his head, and virtuous piety had secured to
his appearance reverence and silent honour, no one, however
determined in his hatred of apostolic descent, could have
listened to his discourse on ecclesiastical history and ancient
times, without thinking that one of the beloved apostles had
returned to mortality, and in that vale of peace had come to
exemplify the beauty of holiness in the life and character of Mr.
Walker.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Until the sickness of his wife, a few months
previous to her death, his health and spirits and faculties were
unimpaired.&nbsp; But this misfortune gave him such a shock, that
his constitution gradually decayed.&nbsp; His senses, except
sight, still preserved their powers.&nbsp; He never preached with
steadiness after his <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>wife&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; His voice
faltered: he always looked at the seat she had used.&nbsp; He
could not pass her tomb without tears.&nbsp; He seemed when alone
sad and melancholy, though still among his friends kind and
good-humoured.&nbsp; He went to bed about twelve o&rsquo;clock
the night before his death.&nbsp; As his custom was, he went
loitering and leaning upon his daughter&rsquo;s arm, to examine
the heavens, and meditate a few moments in the open air.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How clear the moon shines to-night!&rdquo;&nbsp; He said
those words, sighed, and lay down: at six next morning he was
found a corpse.&nbsp; Many a tear, and many a heavy heart, and
many a grateful blessing followed him to the grave.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My good friend,&rdquo; said I, when I had finished
reading to him the above beautiful extract, &ldquo;I beg pardon
for interrupting your narrative, but I am sure you will forgive
me on account of the subject, and because I think what I have
just read contains an answer to your question,&mdash;Why should
we imitate the ancients rather than the moderns?&nbsp; When the
moderns set us a better example than this, we will follow them
with pleasure; but they must excuse us if we wait till
then.&nbsp; I would say, to those who are anxious to set one age
against another, and especially to magnify our own at the expense
of the past, (in the lines of a great and good man,)</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! gather whencesoe&rsquo;er ye
safely may<br />
The help which slackening Piety requires;<br />
Nor deem that he perforce must go astray<br />
Who treads upon the footmarks of his sires.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;They must take long strides,&rdquo; replied the old man
with a smile, &ldquo;who put their feet in the marks left by old
Robert Walker!&nbsp; However, to my tale once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I told you, I had for some time observed a change in
the conduct and spirits of my poor sister Martha, and the looks
exchanged between the good-looking stranger and herself led me to
suspect, with the ready feeling of jealousy, that he might be, in
some way or other, the cause of this great alteration.&nbsp; Yet
I had never seen or heard of him before, as being either a
resident or a visitor in the neighbourhood; nor could I
conjecture how or where they had ever met.&nbsp; I determined,
however, to fathom the mystery, for my sister&rsquo;s welfare was
as dear to me as my own, and I had at least as firm a reliance <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>on her
virtuous resolutions as I had of mine.&nbsp; Nothing, indeed,
could make me for a moment suspect (and the event shows that it
would have been criminal to suspect) that an improper thought or
design had ever crossed her well-regulated mind.&nbsp; Observing
her, one fine evening, during the week that these events
occurred, quietly leave the house after the labours of the day
were concluded, I determined to track her footsteps, though at
such a distance as carefully to avoid her observation.&nbsp; What
a path did she select for her evening&rsquo;s ramble!&nbsp; Sir,
you know the majestic shoulder of old Wraynos, out of which the
river Duddon takes its rise, a little silver stream.&mdash;How it
winds its way past the groves of Birker, under the gigantic
heights of <span class="smcap">Walla-Barrow Crag</span>, and
through the delicious plain of <span
class="smcap">Donnerdale</span>, gathering up the little mountain
rivulets as it hurries on towards the sea, till, at <span
class="smcap">Seathwaite</span>, it becomes a bold and brawling
stream, battling with the vast masses of fallen rock that
encumber its bed, and sprinkling the bushes that stand gazing
into its current with a perpetual dew.&nbsp; Down this romantic
track did my sister haste with a step as light and as timid as a
mountain deer,&mdash;and, sir, the race of the red deer of the
mountain was not extinct in my day, but you often saw their
antlered heads gazing down upon you from heights which the most
experienced shepherd did not dare to climb.&nbsp; She did not,
however, pursue the Duddon as far down as Seathwaite, but turning
up to her left, by the side of a little feeder to the stream,
entered the circular plain of a small valley, which is one of the
most retired and beautiful in the whole region of the
lakes.&nbsp; Every thing in it, houses, trees, and even men, seem
as old, and grey, and peaceful, as the hills which surround
it!&nbsp; Here my suspicions of the object of her journey were at
once confirmed.&nbsp; At the moment she entered the little
circular plain of smooth green-sward from below, the stranger
whom we had encountered on the fell was seen to issue from the
shrubs that clothed the upper termination of the valley; and they
met in the centre with a punctuality which <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>showed&mdash;though my poor sister&rsquo;s step seemed
to slacken a little as they approached&mdash;that the time and
place of meeting were by no means accidental.&nbsp; As I gazed on
his manly form and graceful air, I could not but hope that all
this augured well for my sister&rsquo;s future happiness, though
there was an impression on my mind, from whence gathered I could
not explain, not altogether favourable to the stranger.&nbsp;
Perhaps, thought I, it arises from that jealousy which is always
felt towards those who are found to share in those affections
which we wish, however unreasonably, to keep solely to
ourselves.&nbsp; But what right had I to expect that my
sister&rsquo;s affections should all her life be confined to her
own domestic fire-side?&nbsp; I watched them, therefore, with a
mingled feeling, retire into one of the most secluded parts of
the glen, and hastened to ascend the rock under which they had
placed themselves as if to catch the last rays of the sun as they
threw a parting glance up the western opening of the dale.&nbsp;
All besides was black with shadow, and every singing-bird in the
valley was silent, except a solitary blackbird, who had taken his
stand on the highest twig of a towering birch that was still
gilded with the light of the sun.&nbsp; He whistled a few fine
farewell notes to the day, and then darted down into his thicket
for the night.&nbsp; At that moment I heard my sister&rsquo;s
well-known voice from below, soft and sweet, as if taking up the
song where the blackbird had left off his melody.&nbsp; The air
was one well-known in our valleys, but has not, I dare say,
attracted the attention of those caterers for the mart of music
who gather up our native melodies as men buy up our virgin honey,
at a low rate, and dress them out for higher prices, and a more
fashionable circle.&nbsp; The words were, I believe, her own; for
she possessed a remarkable taste for mountain ballads; or they
might perhaps have been prepared for her by the native poet, of
whom I before spoke to you; for they conveyed a sentiment which
strangely harmonized with my own feelings with regard to the
stranger, and seemed to show that she, too, had her suspicions as
to his character, and was probably almost as ignorant as <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>myself of his
history.&nbsp; Never did notes sound so sweetly on mine ear as at
that moment did my poor sister&rsquo;s song!&nbsp; The
time&mdash;the place&mdash;the feeling that the lines were
dictated by the true sentiments of the heart, all conspired to
impress them on my memory, and to convince me that there was a
power in music to reach the heart, which no other charm
possesses, when the words, the air, and the feeling are in
perfect harmony with each other.&nbsp; I have prepared for you a
copy of the verses, but I cannot convey to you that which is
their greatest charm to me&mdash;the occasion on which they were
first sung.&nbsp; They have also been harmonized by a friend,
who, like myself, has smelt the heather in his youth, and has
infused into the instrumental portion, some of the feeling and
spirit which breathed in my poor sister&rsquo;s melody.&nbsp; You
are heartily welcome to both.</p>

50</span>&ldquo;How shall I paint to you the feelings which
crowded upon my mind as I wended my way homewards on that
memorable evening!&nbsp; The darkening scene, as I crossed the
rugged crest of <span class="smcap">Walna</span>, was
magnificent; and I have always felt that the heart and
imagination expand with the prospect.&nbsp; How the littleness of
human possessions strikes the mind, when we look over the
successive boundaries of a hundred lordships, and feel for the
moment permitted to possess, or at least to enjoy them, as much
as their legal owners!&nbsp; How do human passions die away under
the balmy breath of heaven; and the soul feel its original
relationship to its eternal Author.&nbsp; Yet anxiety for my
sister&rsquo;s welfare pressed upon my mind at that moment with
double force, because I alone was privy to her secret, and as yet
only knew it in a way which prevented me from employing my
knowledge for her good.&nbsp; Yet why should I interfere? was she
not capable of regulating her own conduct, and was there anything
in what I had discovered inconsistent with the prospect of a long
course of happiness before her?&nbsp; With these thoughts I
reached home, and was soon after followed by my sister, whose
unusual absence had been quite unobserved by any other part of
the family, nor did I give any token that it had been noticed by
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You recollect that in our interview with Robert Walker
on the top of <span class="smcap">Walna</span>, we were directed
by him to assemble at his church on the following Sunday, the
children to commence their preparation for Confirmation, and the
parents to present their offspring and themselves to derive
comfort and instruction from the occasion.&nbsp; Never did a
brighter sun shine on the world than that which rose on that
memorable morning!&nbsp; Why, sir, does the sun shine brighter on
a Sunday than on any other day in the week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; said I, sniffing, &ldquo;give a reason
for that which does not exist; but I can see a reason why good
men should sometimes <i>think</i> so, from their mistaking the
warmth and light of gratitude springing up in their own hearts on
that holy day, for the rays of the sun above them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;but I
shall live and die in the belief that there was something warmer
and brighter in the sun on that blessed morning, than I ever felt
either before or since.&nbsp; The early work of the day, (and in
a farm like ours there is always some labour which must
necessarily be attended to even on the Sunday,) was finished <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>long before
the usual hour, and we were all dressed in our very best and on
our way for <span class="smcap">Seathwaite</span> Chapel, soon
after nine o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The early rays of the sun lighted
up Coniston <span class="smcap">Old Man</span>, <a
name="citation52"></a><a href="#footnote52"
class="citation">[52]</a> so that you might count every stone in
his body.&nbsp; As we descended the slope of the mountain side
for the vale of the Duddon, you might see a thousand white
threads of water pouring down from every height that surrounded
the valley, (for there had been a heavy shower of rain in the
night,) and all rushing, with headlong impetuosity, into the
brawling stream below.&nbsp; Then you could trace that stream,
winding its beautiful way, now in sunshine, and now in shadow,
till it gradually widened into a broad estuary, and lost\ itself
in the bay of <span class="smcap">Morecambe</span>, the dark mass
of <span class="smcap">Peel Castle</span> standing calmly amidst
the waves, as if to mark the boundary between the broad river and
the ocean.&nbsp; This sight of itself prepared the mind for the
religious impressions which were to follow; even a child like me
seeing in the picture before him an emblem of the hasty bustle of
time and the quiet repose of eternity; and I could not resist
putting up a silent prayer to <span class="smcap">God</span>,
that the light of His <i>Grace</i> might continue to shine upon
the days of my short and feverish life as the sun in heaven was
then glittering upon the mountain rills, now so bright and busy,
and in a few hours doomed to become silent and still, as though
they had never been.&nbsp; But another sight, still more
impressive, broke on our view as we turned the crest of the
little hill from which we first looked down on the chapel to
which we were tending.&nbsp; Nothing, I believe, puzzles
strangers so much, on visiting our Lake country, as to find out
where all the people live.&nbsp; The houses of the district are
placed in such odd nooks and corners, so buried under little
knolls or spreading trees, and so like the old grey rocks about
them in colour and shape, that an inexperienced traveller might
roam through half that mountainous region, and fancy that its
only inhabitants were sheep, rooks, <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>and wanderers like himself.&nbsp; In
the mining districts, too, one half of the inhabitants live under
ground during the week, and it is only on a Sunday, when they
come up to worship <span class="smcap">God</span> with their
brethren, that they see the light of the blessed day.&nbsp; Hence
it is on Sundays only, that any man, native or stranger, can get
a real sight of the whole population.&nbsp; Now, at the moment I
speak of, just as we got a first view of the whole valley round
Mr. Walker&rsquo;s chapel, the whole population of the district
burst on our sight at once.&nbsp; They were seen pouring over
every height, and hurrying down the breast of every hill, of all
ages, and in dresses of almost every variety of hue.&nbsp; The
matrons, in their scarlet cloaks, which shone brightly among the
green heather, were walking carefully along in groups of two or
three, talking over, no doubt, the events of the week since they
last met, the occasion that now more especially brought them
together, and, it must be confessed, perhaps now and then mixing
with more serious topics a little of the passing scandal of the
country-side.&nbsp; The old grey-coated farmers, with stout
sticks in their hands, said a few words on the subject of prices
at the last Broughton sheep and wool fair; while the young men
and maidens, laughing a little more loudly than the day
justified, and walking a little nearer each other than their
elders always quite approved, seemed to select, by way of
preference, the most rugged and slippery paths they could
find.&nbsp; In front of all rushed on the children and dogs, the
latter, even at church, the better behaved if not the more
intelligent party of the two.&nbsp; I would rather take my chance
in the next world with some of the good dogs that I knew in
Seathwaite, than some of the beasts in human shape that I have
met with since I left it!&nbsp; Well, sir, all these were seen
pouring at once down the hill sides, as lighthearted and cheerful
as the larks over their heads.&nbsp; There could be no mistake as
to the point to which, straggling as they seemed to be in their
course, they were all finally aiming; for the little chapel-bell
of Seathwaite was sending forth its sharp sound, not much louder
than a mountain cuckoo, but still distinctly enough to be heard
throughout <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>the whole region in that still and silent air.&nbsp;
What a picture had we then before us of the <span
class="GutSmall">UNITY</span> of the Church of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>!&nbsp; Though the paths of these men,
in the world, might be different, yet they all met together in
harmony in the House of <span class="smcap">God</span>&mdash;they
all aimed at one point&mdash;they all hoped to be saved by the
same faith.&nbsp; Here there was indeed &lsquo;one house
appointed for all living&rsquo;&mdash;to pray in during life, to
rest in after death.&nbsp; They all took Seathwaite chapel on
their road to heaven!&nbsp; The bell which called them together
to prayer was not much larger than a sheep bell, but it was
obeyed by all the flock with a readiness which shewed how anxious
they all were to be included within the fold of the <span
class="smcap">Good Shepherd</span> of their souls.&nbsp;
Doubtless He was present in spirit.&nbsp; His minister on earth,
as far as that little flock was concerned, was there in person;
ready, as he always was, to see his flock, and administer to
their spiritual comforts.&nbsp; There he stood, at the door of
his humble parsonage, in his stuff gown and cassock, and his
silver locks streaming in the wind, greeting every one as he
passed by his door on the way to the chapel, and listening kindly
to any little intelligence, either of joy or of sorrow, which the
events of the last week might have brought forth.&nbsp; What a
crowd there was assembled within and around that humble chapel,
on that Sunday morning!&nbsp; There was not sitting or rather
kneeling room for one half of the congregation.&nbsp; For though
probably the number of candidates for Confirmation did not much
exceed a dozen, yet Mr. Walker&rsquo;s expressed wish, (and his
wish was law,) had brought together all the parents, god-fathers
and god-mothers, and elder brothers and sisters of every
candidate, that they might be, on that occasion, reminded of
their own Christian duties.&nbsp; These, together with a number
of strangers attracted by the unusual circumstances, swelled the
congregation to an amount far exceeding what the little chapel
could contain; and so they stood about the door, or sat upon the
walls and grave-stones of the church-yard, which, to a
mountain-race on a fine autumn morning, formed quite as agreeable
a temple of worship as the close-packed and somewhat <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>mouldy space
within.&nbsp; We, as being somewhat visitors and I a candidate,
were civilly accommodated with seats by one to whom we were well
known, and so heard and saw every thing that passed.&nbsp; There
was no distinction of seats, or rather <i>forms</i>, in that
little house of prayer.&nbsp; The forms all looked to the east,
being entered from one small aisle which ran up from the west
door to the altar.&nbsp; The people sat in families, but without
distinction as to rank, all going to the place where their
fathers had worshipped before, from time immemorial.&nbsp; The
only difference was, that as each by degrees grew old and deaf,
they advanced a step nearer the altar, that they might be able
better to hear and see the clergyman.&nbsp; Thus the more sacred
part of the building was surrounded by those who from age and
spiritual experience deserved to be exalted in the Church of
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>&mdash;they were, as it were,
the Elders round about the throne&mdash;they were a connecting
link between minister and people&mdash;they were looked up to by
those who sat behind, as their parents and examples; and no doubt
it was an ambitious wish in the hearts of many of the younger,
that as <i>they</i> advanced in years they might be thought
worthy to fill that honoured circle, and receive the respect
which they were then paying to their elders.&nbsp; Surely, sir,
this is a more becoming way of encircling the altar of our <span
class="smcap">God</span>, than by crowding its steps with idle
and ill-mannered boys, as is too often the case in town churches,
putting those at the head who ought to be but at the entrance of
the Church of <span class="smcap">Christ</span>, and filling our
minds, as we think of that sacred portion of the House of <span
class="smcap">God</span>, with the image of a school-master with
his ferula instead of a priest in his holy vestments!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am nearly of your mind,&rdquo; said I, smiling at the
quaintness of his notion, &ldquo;but you must recollect that
necessity has no law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;most true.&nbsp; Well,
sir, there we were, waiting in anxious expectation for the
stopping of the little tinkling bell, and the arrival of the
clergyman, for no one thought of sitting down till he
appeared.&nbsp; At length he advanced, with a grave face, and
placid countenance, <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>bowing slightly to all as he passed, but with his eyes
fixed right before him till he reached the little altar, over the
rails of which hung the surplice.&nbsp; This was reverently
placed on his shoulders by a man almost as old and grey-headed as
himself, and evidently dressed in some of the minister&rsquo;s
old raiment.&nbsp; The effect of this robing in the sight of the
congregation was very impressive.&nbsp; You saw as it were with
your eyes the putting off of the man and the putting on of the
minister.&nbsp; The world was lost for a time, and shrouded by
the clean white robe of the messenger of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.&nbsp; I have often thought that
vestries, in and out of which the minister of a large town church
pops as in a play, destroy the effect which was certainly
produced on my mind by this robing of Robert Walker in the sight
of the people.&nbsp; The service began with a psalm, selected and
given out by Walker himself.&nbsp; His voice was rather thin from
age, but clear and distinct, for he had lost none of his teeth,
and his reading of the lines was like the sound of an instrument
of music.&nbsp; He read each verse separately, and separately
they were sung.&nbsp; The lines which he chose were the following
from the Old Version of the Psalms, which he always used not only
as being more near the original and more devotional in their
spirit than the new, but as consisting mainly of words of one
syllable, and expressly adapted to the plain-song of
congregational singing.&nbsp; When shall I forget the musical
cadences with which he gave out the following simple lines from
the 34th psalm?</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Come neare to me my children deare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to my words give eare:<br />
I shall ye teach the perfect way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How ye the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall
feare.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is the man that would live long,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lead a blessed life?<br />
See thou refraine thy tongue and lips<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From all deceit and strife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Turn back thy face from doing ill,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And do the godly deed:<br />
Inquire for peace and quietnesse,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And follow it with speed.</p>
<p><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>&lsquo;For why? the eyes of <span
class="smcap">God</span> above<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the just are bent:<br />
His eares likewise do heare the plaint<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the poor innocent.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I wish, sir, you had heard the way in which the giving
out of the first verse of this psalm was responded to by the
congregation!&nbsp; There was no praising <span
class="smcap">God</span> by deputy&mdash;no leaving this
delightful part of the service to a few women in pink bonnets,
and men in well-curled locks, stuck up in a gallery in front of a
conceited organist, mincing <span
class="smcap">God</span>&rsquo;s praise in softly warbled tones,
and ready to sing to-morrow with just the same zeal and devotion
in a Roman Catholic Chapel or an Italian Concert Hall, if they
are equally well paid for their professional services.&nbsp; No,
sir! every man, woman, and child sung for themselves, lustily,
and with a right good will.&nbsp; They sung the air in a minor
key, as is always the case among the inhabitants of mountain
districts, perhaps because they learn to pitch their notes to the
echoes of their native valleys; but it had from that circumstance
a more solemn and devotional effect.&nbsp; It was taken up by
those without the doors with the same zeal as by those within,
for all knew the air as familiarly as their own names.&nbsp; Here
was a strict compliance with David&rsquo;s precept, &lsquo;Young
men and maidens, old men and children, praise ye the name of the
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>.&rsquo;&nbsp; The mighty sound
rushed down the vale of <span class="smcap">Ulpha</span> like the
bursting of a mountain cataract; nor, for aught I can tell, was
it checked in its onward course till it had scaled the heights of
the surrounding mountains, and died away at last, in a gentle
whisper, on the lonely summit of <span class="smcap">Black
Comb</span>!&nbsp; <i>Died away</i>, did I say?&nbsp; Forgive me,
sir, the lowly thought!&nbsp; Far higher than the cliffs of <span
class="smcap">Helvellyn</span> did that holy psalm ascend; nor
stayed it in its upward flight till it approached, as a memorial
of sweet incense, the throne of <span
class="smcap">God</span>&mdash;there to be heard again when
earthly sound shall be no more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a single tear on the old man&rsquo;s withered cheek
as he said this, and a twitching about the rigid muscles of his
mouth, which showed that his iron frame <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>could still
vibrate to the gentle recollections of his youth.&nbsp; He paused
in his narrative; and there was a solemn silence between us of
some minutes&rsquo; duration.&nbsp; At length he
resumed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The saying of the Church Service followed with the same
calm solemnity and devotion with which it began.&nbsp; It was
clear that the object of the priest was to forget himself, and
lead the worshippers to forget him, in the high service in which
both were engaged; and in this he fully succeeded.&nbsp; It was
not till the worship prescribed by the Church was ended, and the
last Amen had died on the ear, that a sensation of curiosity
seemed to run through the assembly, and those without began to
crowd nearer the door, as though something unusual was about to
take place, and they were anxious to catch words less familiar to
their ears than the well-known language of the Prayer Book.&nbsp;
There was little preparation necessary for the sermon.&nbsp; The
preacher did not leave his place to change his sacred vestments
for a black gown, as is now the general fashion.&nbsp; His place
of prayer was also his place of preaching.&nbsp; I should explain
that what we call the reading-desk was placed in the north-east
corner of the little chapel, having two ledges for his books, one
looking to the south, and the other (which also formed the door)
to the west.&nbsp; On the former rested the Prayer Book, and on
the latter the Bible; so that when he prayed, he naturally turned
to the altar,&mdash;when he read the Scriptures, towards the
people.&nbsp; When he began to preach, therefore, he simply
turned to the people as when he had read the lessons, resting his
sermon on the Bible&mdash;no bad foundation, you will say,&rdquo;
added the old man with a smile, &ldquo;for a scriptural
discourse!&nbsp; His text was a very short and simple one but had
he sought the whole Bible through, he could not have found one
better adapted to my state of mind than the one he chose&mdash;my
disposition being at that time, as I before observed, to take a
somewhat gloomy and severe view of the Gospel; it was
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">God</span> is love.&rsquo;&nbsp; All
my dark fears vanished at the <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>sound; and I waited not to hear the
reasons to be convinced that the essence of the Gospel is indeed
&lsquo;glad tidings&rsquo; to mankind.&nbsp; There was an
unwonted appearance of excitement about the preacher as he gave
forth his text, and turned over the leaves of the manuscript
which lay before him, looking first at it, and then at the crowd
of upturned and expecting faces before him with an expression
which I did not at first comprehend.&nbsp; He paused before he
commenced his sermon, as if he could hardly read his own
hand-writing, and yet nothing could be plainer or more distinct
than his penmanship, even to the end of his days.&nbsp; At last
he seemed to have made up his mind.&nbsp; He closed his sermon
with a force which seemed to shew that he had come to a final
determination, and deliberately put it into the pocket of his
cassock; he then cleared his voice, paused for an instant, and
commenced as follows.&nbsp; You will not expect me to remember
every word of the discourse; indeed, perhaps you will be
surprised that I should remember it at all; but the substance of
it, and often the very words and looks of the preacher still
cling to my memory, with a firmness of which nothing can deprive
them but the coming grave!&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My</span> brethren,&rsquo;
said the priest, resting his hand on the Bible, and looking round
upon the anxious audience with an expression which showed some
degree of agitation of mind, mixed with his habitual calmness and
self-possession,&mdash;&lsquo;My <i>dear</i> brethren, I am about
to do what is quite unusual, and, I fear, wrong in me;&mdash;I am
about to address you in language which I have not first carefully
considered, and, word for word, committed to paper.&nbsp; Though
I have preached the blessed Gospel of our <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> to you and your fathers, from this
place, for the long period of fifty years, I have never ventured
to do this before.&nbsp; I have had too much fear both for myself
and you&mdash;too much anxiety that not a word should drop from
me which was not agreeable to the language and spirit of the
Gospel, to trust myself to unarranged thoughts, and unconsidered
words.&nbsp; But fifty years have given confidence to my mind,
that nothing which is not of <span class="smcap">God</span> can
slip from me in this house, even in the warmth and heat of a
moment like this; and thoughts arise <i>now</i> in my mind which
seem fitted for the occasion, and yet which had not occurred to
me in the silent meditation of my closet.&nbsp; And surely I have
<i>experienced</i> too long the full enjoyment of that holy truth
that &ldquo;<span class="smcap">God</span> is love,&rdquo; to
shrink from speaking of it, (and especially before you, my
children,) without shame, and without fear!&nbsp; I call you my
children; for many as are the <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>grey heads that I now see before me,
there is hardly one who has been born again into the blessed
kingdom of our <span class="smcap">Lord</span> without the
ministration of these hands, unworthy as indeed they are to be
made the instruments of so divine a thing!&nbsp; There is one,
indeed, now present,&rsquo;&mdash;here his eye naturally turned
to the seat almost close beside him, in which sat the venerable
partner of his joys and cares, (<i>sorrows</i>, I believe, in the
worldly sense, he was too good a man to have any,) in her little
black silk quaker-like bonnet, and neat white cap; retaining on
her cheeks much of the bloom and some of the beauty which had
made her, between sixty and seventy years ago, the admiration of
the parish:&mdash;&lsquo;There is <i>one</i>, indeed,&rsquo; he
repeated; his voice faltered, and it was clear that he would have
some difficulty in proceeding with his discourse: and here it was
beautiful to observe what happened.&nbsp; The old lady, seeing
how matters stood, looked up to him from under her bonnet with a
quiet smile, conveying at once an expression of kind
encouragement and gentle rebuke, which is quite
indescribable.&nbsp; The effect was immediate.&nbsp; A slight
flush of shame crossed the old man&rsquo;s brow, and he at once
resumed his wonted composure.&nbsp; There was something in that
smile which had reminded him of the days of their
youth&mdash;when she was the buxom maiden and he the gallant
lover&mdash;and he doubtless felt some shame that he should not
show himself at least as firm and as youthful as his dame; and so
his face naturally took up an expression in quiet harmony with
hers, and he became at once himself again.&nbsp; Sir, it was
beautiful!&nbsp; I would not have missed observing it for the
world.&nbsp; Doubtless, these were mere human feelings intruding
themselves into the house of <span class="smcap">God</span>, but
I cannot believe they were sinful.&nbsp; It was like a gleam of
earthly sunshine streaming through the painted windows of the
chancel of a cathedral, glancing upon, and not polluting, the
holy pavement of the sanctuary!&rdquo;&mdash;The old man paused
as if pleased with his own thoughts, and then proceeded with his
recollections of the sermon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You,&rsquo; said the preacher, &lsquo;have been
my scholars, and <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>sometimes, I confess, my teachers, for many a year; for
while you have learned from me the truths of the Gospel, I have
often drawn from you&mdash;your patience, your cheerfulness, your
submission to the will of <span class="smcap">God</span>&mdash;a
lesson as to the right way of putting the Gospel into
practice.&nbsp; Much, too, have I learned from your sins, your
negligences, and ignorances.&nbsp; But all
combines,&mdash;strength and weakness, life and death, the works
of <span class="smcap">God</span> and the Word of <span
class="smcap">God</span>,&mdash;to teach us all the great, the
essential doctrine of the text, &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">God</span> is love!&rdquo;&nbsp; See how He has
shown it in our creation and our redemption, in the world around
us, and in the world within us&mdash;the kingdom of earth, and
the kingdom of heaven!&nbsp; How <i>like</i>, too, are His
bounties and loving-kindnesses in both these kingdoms!&nbsp; It
is indeed &ldquo;the <i>same</i> <span class="smcap">God</span>,
that worketh all in all.&rdquo;&nbsp; Look around you, as I have
often before told you to do, on human life, and especially on
your own life, and the blessings which each of you possess.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">God</span> is with you in spiritual and
temporal things, always turning upon you the same face of
love.&nbsp; He has given you an earthly world in which you are to
live here below.&nbsp; He gave you breath to begin life, and
strength to continue it.&nbsp; He gives you food in health,
medicine in sickness, parents and friends to guard and instruct
you in youth, companions in middle life, and children to be a
comfort in old age.&nbsp; He surrounds you with beauty to cheer
your hearts on every side; sunshine and shadow, the fruitful
plains and the everlasting hills, the fertilizing streams, and
the bright and silent stars.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span>, in short, shows Himself to you in love
and beauty, through every stage of your mortal life; and so it is
with your spiritual life,&mdash;that life which He has given you
in His dear <span class="smcap">Son</span>.&nbsp; Love rules in
grace as well as in nature.&nbsp; Love brought down the <span
class="smcap">Saviour</span> to die for you when you were
dead&mdash;all dead&mdash;in trespasses and sins.&nbsp; Love sent
down the Holy <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> to earth, by Whom
ye were born again into the kingdom of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>, as ye were born into this world by
the breath of the same <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> when ye
were but insensible dust.&nbsp; And your spiritual life is
surrounded with love and kindness like your natural life, <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>from its
beginning on earth to its consummation in heaven.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God</span>&rsquo;s Bible, like His world, is full
of love and beauty.&nbsp; It tells you to whom you are to listen,
namely, His ministers; through what you are to seek grace,
namely, His sacraments; through Whom alone you are to be saved,
namely, His <span class="smcap">Son</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He then proceeded to show more especially how this love
was shown in the institution of the rite of Confirmation, by
which careful training of the youth of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span>&rsquo;s Church in faith and practice
was secured, and all ages taught how they must act together in
furthering the common good, the older being bound to teach the
young, and the young to listen to the old; while both learned to
feel their submission to the rule of the Church, in having to
submit to the Bishop, as its head, the test of their mutual
obedience to her laws.&nbsp; &lsquo;But,&rsquo; he added,
&lsquo;I will not now dwell more on the rite of Confirmation, as
the older have already had their instruction in it, and that of
the younger will soon follow.&nbsp; I wish to say a word to you
all on another matter, which I confess weighs heavily on my mind,
and no occasion may again occur on which I can do it so properly
as at present.&nbsp; You are surrounded with spiritual enemies on
every side, and it is my particular duty to warn you of your
danger.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God</span> be thanked, the foe
has not yet scaled the walls of this parish, but he is loudly
battering at its ramparts!&nbsp; Look at all the various kinds of
dissent from the Church&rsquo;s unity, which now stalk abroad
with shameless front!&nbsp; Now all dissent is <i>sin</i>, less
or more.&nbsp; If it differs not from the truth, it is the more
unpardonable for its schism&mdash;if it does differ, so far as it
differs it is the more sinful.&nbsp; Look at popery, which is
dissent in the mask of unity&mdash;error the more dangerous for
boasting itself to be the truth.&nbsp; Look, again, at
infidelity&mdash;the blasphemies of Tom Paine; beware, my
children, of this sin, for I hear it has come nigh you, even to
your doors.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Here a sensation of wondering horror
ran through the assembled crowd.)&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you ask me for
a safeguard against these snares?&nbsp; I answer, meddle not with
them!&nbsp; He that toucheth pitch <i>will</i> be defiled.&nbsp;
To be tempted of <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>the devil is trial enough for poor mortals to endure,
but to tempt the devil himself, is of all follies the most
unpardonable!&nbsp; It is not my duty, for it is impossible for
me, to answer all the forms of error; but it <i>is</i> my duty to
warn you against them all; and I do so by giving you one simple
safeguard, which will apply to them all alike: it is
this&mdash;<i>take my word for it</i>, <i>that your Church is
true</i>.&mdash;<i>Somebody&rsquo;s</i> word you <i>must</i>
take, for you are too unlearned to judge of these deep matters
for yourselves, and why not <i>mine</i>?&nbsp; Have I any
interest, have I any wish to deceive you?&nbsp; Does not my
salvation rest upon my securing your own?&nbsp; Have I not given
my nights and my days to the study of the truth?&nbsp; Has not
the Bishop, my spiritual head, commissioned me to preach it to
you?&nbsp; Have I any thing in this world that I can desire in
comparison with the salvation of your souls?&nbsp; Do not my
hoary locks, and shrinking frame, proclaim that here I have no
continuing city, but must soon give an account of my stewardship
to Him that sent me?&nbsp; Has not the Bible been my companion,
and the wisest and best of all ages its interpreters for me, for
nearly a century?&nbsp; If these things cannot be spoken against,
take my word for it, till you have that of one whom you have more
reasons for believing, that if you take the Bible as your law,
and the Prayer Book as your practical rule of life, living up to
both with a good conscience, then, my life for yours&mdash;my
<i>eternal</i> life for yours&mdash;you will at last find the
path I now point out to you,&mdash;the path that leads to
heaven!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The venerable preacher gave utterance to these words
with a passionate earnestness which went to the hearts of all
present, and very few who heard them will ever forget either
their sound or their meaning.&nbsp; He then proceeded more calmly
to press on his hearers their several duties to <span
class="smcap">God</span> and to each other, and dismissed the
vast assembly with his blessing, given with all the dignity of a
patriarch.&nbsp; I need not relate to you how crowded was his
mid-day meal,&mdash;how attentively listened to his evening
sermon.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, that we were instructed in every
point of the solemn vow which we were about to take, on our <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>own behalf,
before the Bishop, in such a manner as might be expected from
<span class="smcap">Robert Walker</span>.&nbsp; I must, however,
mention two events more, connected with this little history of
our Confirmation, the one very ridiculous, the other almost
sublime; because they have each their proper moral attached to
them.&nbsp; Among the other candidates for Confirmation was our
old friend Tom Hebblethwaite, whom I have long since forgiven for
the sound beating he gave me at Hawkshead, but whom I never
<i>can</i> forgive for cutting off the old cock&rsquo;s
tail!&nbsp; Tom was stupid and sullen as usual, but at the same
time, thanks to old Bowman&rsquo;s birch, had acquired
information enough about his catechism to prevent Mr. Walker from
absolutely refusing him his ticket.&nbsp; Accordingly, he was one
of the party who started off together from <span
class="smcap">Yewdale</span> to <span
class="smcap">Ulverston</span> on the morning on which the
confirmation was to be held in the church of that town, by the
Lord Bishop of Chester.&nbsp; We were a sober and steady young
party, attended by our parents, and one or two god-fathers and
god-mothers who knew their duty; and the mirth, which generally
attends such meetings of the youth of both sexes, was sobered
down into quiet and decorous conversation by the seriousness of
the occasion which had brought us together.&nbsp; All except Tom,
who, generally dull and stupid enough, seemed excited into a kind
of perverse and ungainly liveliness, which increased into
boisterous folly with every rebuke from those older than
himself.&nbsp; At length we arrived at <span
class="smcap">Penny-Bridge</span>, just below Mr. <span
class="smcap">Machell</span>&rsquo;s house, when the stream was
then crossed, (I know not how it is now,) not by a bridge, as one
might expect from its name, but what are there called
&lsquo;hipping-stones,&rsquo; large blocks of rock placed at
intervals, so that the passenger had to skip from one to another
in order to cross the water.&nbsp; Tom challenged his companions
to go over on one leg,&mdash;a feat which many there could have
performed, had they not one and all felt themselves restrained
from such a childish frolic by the solemnity of the
occasion.&nbsp; Now it is a strange trait in human nature that
the very feelings which held back the really brave, seemed to
give a momentary courage to the <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>coward; and Tom undertook to perform
to-day what nobody would give him credit for ever thinking of on
any other day in the year.&nbsp; But the fate of all such rash
adventurers&mdash;and which every one hoped rather than
expected&mdash;on this occasion befell Tom Hebblethwaite.&nbsp;
Just when he came to the largest stone, and the deepest hole in
the river, Tom&rsquo;s courage and foot gave way together, and
down he soused over head and ears into the water, nothing being
seen of him, for a moment, but his hat, which, being the lightest
part about him, (it was a new one for the occasion,) refused to
sink with the rest of his body, and soon commenced a voyage
towards <span class="smcap">Peel Castle</span> and the <span
class="smcap">Pile</span> of <span
class="smcap">Foudrey</span>,&mdash;a voyage which nobody present
seemed inclined to interrupt.&nbsp; Tom himself, however, was
kindly fished up out of an element which seemed to have been of
service neither to his body nor to his mind; for, without staying
to thank his deliverers, he immediately commenced a rapid retreat
homewards, and, I dare say, remains unconfirmed, (except in his
sullenness and obstinate temper,) to the present hour!&nbsp; It
was some time before we could recover our composure, which had
been ruffled by this ludicrous event; but the sight of the
assembly around the church and church-yard of Ulverston
effectually sobered the thoughts of even the most volatile of our
party; for there can be no sight more solemn than that of a
Confirmation in a fine open country, and in a church situated
like that of Ulverston, surrounded by scattered and towering
hills, with the broad ocean in the distance.&nbsp; There were the
rural shepherds at the head of their flocks, hastening to present
their young lambs to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>, that
they might receive His blessing from the hands of His chief
minister on earth.&nbsp; Our own beloved pastor was already at
his post, standing waiting for us at the church-door in his
well-known gown and cassock, and ready to head us up to the rails
of the altar.&nbsp; Way was made for him by his younger brethren
of the clergy, as he advanced steadily up the aisle, followed by
his children; and what was our surprise and delight to see the
Bishop himself, in his white robes, advance two or three steps to
meet him, <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>and shake him most affectionately by the hand.&nbsp;
There was a smile of approbation on the faces of the surrounding
clergy as they witnessed this scene, which showed that no feeling
of jealousy was excited in their minds by this kindness on the
part of the Bishop, but that they all looked upon it in its true
light&mdash;as a just reward of pious and unpretending
merit.&nbsp; How proud we all were at that moment of belonging to
the flock of <span class="smcap">Robert Walker</span>!&nbsp; We
each felt as if we had a personal share in his distinction, and
many of us resolved then, I doubt not, to do nothing which should
bring disgrace upon a teacher so honoured among his brethren as
ours!&nbsp; This, sir, I have learned since to believe, is a
wrong feeling; we ought to follow the right path from higher
motives than a feeling of pride, either in ourselves or
others.&nbsp; But surely our human passions may sometimes justly
be employed for good ends.&nbsp; What is it but taking one of the
Devil&rsquo;s strongest and most wiry snares, and twisting it
into a three-fold cord to bind us faster to the altar?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">You</span> must prepare
yourself,&rdquo; continued the old man, to be somewhat surprised
with what I am going to relate to you, if you have not (as I
have) lived long enough in the world not to be much surprised at
any thing.&nbsp; Things are so mixed up in this world, and very
trifling, or even absurd events so often lead to very serious
consequences, that I can quite believe the stories one hears of
the spilling of a cup of tea creating a war between two nations,
or the boring of a rat-hole causing the inundation of
Holland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One very fine morning, at this period of my narrative,
Gawen Braithwaite, a stout young man of rather more than my own
age, the son of a neighbouring statesman, and myself, sallied
forth on an excursion of a character not uncommon among the young
men of that country in my early days, and probably still
prevailing,&mdash;which combined the three great excitements to
youth for any similar undertaking, viz. pleasure, danger, and
sometimes profit.&nbsp; This was, the gathering <i>ruddle</i> in
the <span class="smcap">Screes</span> of Wastdale.&nbsp; This
operation will require some explanation to make it <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>intelligible
to you.&nbsp; <i>Ruddle</i> is a stone strongly mixed with iron,
which, by wetting and rubbing, produces a deep red paint which
hardly any exposure to the weather can wash away, especially when
stained upon an oily substance like wool.&nbsp; Now this ruddle
the shepherds of the mountains use to mark their sheep with, that
it may be known to whom they belong.&nbsp; As the sheep range
over a wide and unenclosed extent of moor and fell, they often
ramble far from home, and though each shepherd well knows every
one of his own sheep by face, yet strangers could not know to
whom a stray animal belonged, unless it bore some mark to point
out its owner.&nbsp; Hence the occupier of every sheep-farm has
his own peculiar mark, which has been used on that farm time out
of mind, by which his sheep are known all over the country-side;
and at sheep-shearings, which are always times of great festivity
and rejoicing, the shepherds assemble from all parts of the
country, and choose out their own stray sheep from each flock as
it is shorn, appealing to their well-known marks as proofs of
ownership.&nbsp; These marks, as I said, are made by the mineral
called <i>ruddle</i>, which, being very scarce, has a
considerable value in the market, fetching as much as at least
sixpence a pound.&nbsp; Now sixpences are not very abundant in
the pockets of country lads; and they are very glad to secure
them, even though it be but by one at a time, at the expense of
wasting many hours, which they value little, and at much risk of
their necks, which they value less.&nbsp; It happens that this
<i>ruddle</i> is principally to be found in the most dangerous
place in all the lake country&mdash;a place which you must have
seen, for it is visited by all tourists who wish to explore by
far the finest part of all that beautiful district&mdash;the
<span class="smcap">Screes</span> of Wast-water.&nbsp; These
Screes are a long and lofty ridge of almost perpendicular rocks,
running from <span class="smcap">Scaw-fell</span> towards the
sea, along the whole southern side of the lake of Wastdale, and
are of so brittle and crumbling a nature, that almost the
smallest pebble, set rolling from above, will gather a host of
them as it goes, till a whole army of little stones rush
pell-mell to <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>the bottom of the rock and plunge headlong into the dark
lake below, at least fifty fathoms deep!&nbsp; It is on the face
and half way down the side of this shivery rock that the little
veins of <i>ruddle</i> are to be found, and you may guess the
steady step and firm nerve which are required to descend the
surface of the steep and loose declivity, and avoid any
disturbance of that rolling mass, which, once commencing its
movements, would to a certainty hurl the bold adventurer to the
bottom.&nbsp; Many lives have been lost in this perilous
pursuit.&nbsp; However, Gawen Braithwaite and I were not deterred
by the danger, but rather impelled by it to encounter a risk
which we had often before tried and escaped.&nbsp; Up Langdale,
then, we sallied; and crossing Stye-Head, made our way to the
left under the peaks of Scaw-fell Pikes, through the stormy gap
of Mickle-door, and descended the face of the Screes with that
boldness of heart and step, which is the best pledge of
safety.&nbsp; We were on this day more than usually successful in
the object of our search; and before the sun had descended
between the double peaks of the Isle of Man, had filled our bags
with the treasure which we so highly prized, and sat down on the
top of the Screes to eat our first meal since we left home, and
watch at the same time the last rays of the sun tingeing the sea
with gold, and the top of <span class="smcap">Great Gavel</span>
with a deep purple&mdash;his base being already lost in
shadow.&nbsp; In the gaiety of our hearts we ended our repast by
smearing our faces with the <i>ruddle</i>: and, having added a
few dark lines to the portrait by the aid of some bastard coal
which is there found, we were quite prepared to startle to our
hearts&rsquo; content any rustic maiden that might have the
misfortune to encounter us on our way home&mdash;a feat not very
uncommon in a country where amusements are not so easily found as
in towns like this.&nbsp; The lengthening shadows of the evening
soon warned us of the approach of night; and we commenced our
return with light hearts and heavy sacks of <i>ruddle</i>,
keeping the high ground and the slopes of the hill-sides rather
than descending into the valleys below, both because the ground
<a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>was there
more solid to the step, and because&mdash;the truth must be
confessed&mdash;we thought we were less likely to meet with
<i>ghosts</i> on the open plain, than in the dark lurking-places
and shadowy recesses of the glens, which have been supposed, from
time immemorial, their favourite habitations!&nbsp; Yet, strange
as it may appear, this very avoidance of ghostly haunts led us
not only into their chosen dwelling places, but converted us into
ghosts ourselves; as you shall hear.&nbsp; Gawen Braithwaite was
somewhat in advance of me as we crossed the bold point of the
crag which runs out between the vale of Langdale and the dale
that leads towards the foot of Hardknot, when he suddenly
disappeared among some close bushes of hazel, which here fringe
the rock from the river below almost to the crown of the
hill.&nbsp; Conceiving that he had stumbled under his weight
among the hidden stones (for it was now almost dark even on the
hill tops) I hastened forward to his relief, when, to my great
surprise, I found that he had disappeared altogether from
view.&nbsp; I called aloud, and, receiving no answer, I became
dreadfully alarmed, thinking that <i>he</i>, who, I soon
recollected, had no right to poor Gawen, had flown off with him
bodily!&nbsp; At last I heard his voice from below feebly calling
on me to help him, and then found that he had fallen into a deep
and unsuspected cavern, and was unable to get out without my
assistance.&nbsp; I descended carefully to the place where he was
lying, and found him not at all hurt; but he trembled
exceedingly, and putting his hand to his mouth as a signal for my
silence, he pointed to an object below, which put me at once into
as great a fright as himself.&nbsp; We could both see distinctly
a faint glimmering of light, though far beneath us; and as we
held our breaths from very terror, sometimes fancied we could
hear the sound of human voices in the very bowels of the
hills.&nbsp; At last our doubts were changed into certainty; and
gathering courage by the assurance that the sounds which we heard
were not <i>inhuman</i>, our curiosity began to get the better of
our fears, and we quietly worked our way downwards among the
rocks and closely-woven bushes, till the <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>light grew
brighter, and the sounds fell more distinctly on our ears.&nbsp;
At last a sight burst upon us which astonished us both not a
little.&nbsp; Stepping quietly down upon a jutting projection of
rock, we obtained the full view of a large cavern, evidently the
old working of a slate-mine which had been long deserted, and the
entrance to which (at the opposite end from where we stood) had
been almost forgotten even by the natives.&nbsp; The hills
thereabouts are, in fact, full of such old workings.&nbsp; There,
round a large fire, which answered the purpose both of light and
heat, we saw arranged a large circle of men, some standing, some
leaning against the rocks, and some sitting round the fire, while
one stood in the middle addressing them with great earnestness,
and much and very graceful action.&nbsp; I immediately recognized
the orator as one whom I had seen before, and much surprised and
grieved was I to see him under such circumstances.&nbsp; Have you
any idea, sir, who he was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the handsome stranger, the lover and loved of my
poor sister Martha!&nbsp; The whole secret was now out; the
mystery was now at an end.&nbsp; This man, whose appearance and
occupations among our quiet mountains no one could account for,
was, in fact, a champion of the French Revolution, and a spreader
of the pestilent doctrines of Tom Paine!&nbsp; Whether he was
employed by others, or whether he came impelled only by his own
perverted zeal in this evil cause, was never known; but his
object was to spread the principles of Infidelity and Revolution
(and when were these principles ever separated?) among the miners
of Cumberland, and, through them, among the peaceful and pious
inhabitants of the north!&nbsp; Can you, sir, conceive a design
more fiendish than this?&mdash;well worthy the exploits of his
first &lsquo;father&rsquo; in the garden of Eden!&nbsp; There,
however, in that old and forgotten mine, he had secretly
assembled the workmen and others together, and was in the very
midst of his exhortation when Gawen Braithwaite and I became so
unexpectedly a portion of his auditory.&nbsp; As we recovered our
<a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>self-possession, and found that we were completely
screened from view by the shadows which filled the whole of the
upper end of the cave, we could gradually trace out some faces
that we knew; and amongst the rest one or two whose presence in
such company caused us no little surprise.&nbsp; How little, sir,
do we know the real opinions, even of our next neighbours!&nbsp;
There we saw William Tyson,&mdash;no relation of old <span
class="smcap">Tommy Tyson</span>, king of Wastdale-Head&mdash;for
he is as honest a king as ever reigned, and, at the same time, as
good a subject to the Queen as ever lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest king Tommy,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he indeed?&rdquo; said the old man, in a lower tone
than he had been speaking in just before; &ldquo;I grieve to hear
it; but all men, even kings, must die; and I trust he has left a
successor to his humble throne among his native hills, as worthy
to reign as himself and his ancestors.&nbsp; William Tyson was a
neighbour of our own, and owner of a very neat homestead and
large sheep-farm in the vale of Tilberthwaite.&nbsp; One could
see no possible reason why one so well to do in the world should
feel any dissatisfaction either with Church or State.&nbsp; But,
sir, what has reason to do with follies like these?&nbsp; William
was a man &lsquo;wise in his own conceit,&rsquo; and I do not
think Solomon was far wrong when he said of such a one, that
&lsquo;there is more hope of a fool than of him.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Well, sir, Gawen and I lent our ears most attentively to catch
the substance of the handsome stranger&rsquo;s address, and soon
found that he was speaking of the equality of civil rights, to
which, he said, all men were born by nature.&nbsp; &lsquo;All
men,&rsquo; cried he, &lsquo;come into the world in precisely the
same condition.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I do not see how that can
well be,&rsquo; said a decrepid-looking wretch sitting close to
the speaker, &lsquo;when I came into the world with a withered
arm and leg, which have hardly ever grown since, and Jack Strong
there was born with the limbs of a giant, and the strength of a
buffalo!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I speak not of natural, but of civil
equality,&rsquo; said the stranger, somewhat puzzled by the
objection; &lsquo;I mean that one man has as much right to
property as another.&rsquo;&nbsp; <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>&lsquo;Aye, aye,&rsquo; said William
Tyson, much pleased with this view of the subject, &lsquo;I have
long thought myself quite as much entitled to Coniston Hall as
Sir Daniel le Fleming himself, and should much like to have the
guiding of it for the rest of my days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wus ye may get it,&rsquo; said Peter Hoggarth, one of
William&rsquo;s own shepherds, who was standing unexpectedly near
his master; &lsquo;<i>I</i> shall be satisfied with <i>your</i>
bonny holmes of Grey Goosthwaite, which I think I can farm quite
as well as my master!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;William Tyson was evidently by no means pleased with
this intrusion of his own shepherd&rsquo;s; for it was clear that
he had no manner of intention of resigning Grey Goosthwaite to
his herdsman when he took possession himself of the broad acres
of Coniston Hall.&nbsp; So true is it, that all men would level
<i>up</i> to those above them, none <i>down</i> to those below
them!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The speaker now turned to the religious part of his
subject, on which he expressed himself with great fluency and
plausibility.&nbsp; He stated that much, which was mistaken for
religion, was in reality nothing more than early prejudice and
weak superstition.&nbsp; He instanced this, by ridiculing the
strange belief in ghosts and spirits which was once so prevalent
in these valleys, but was now fast disappearing before the light
of advancing knowledge and science.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
miner,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;used to hear the mysterious
knocking, and the supernatural signals of the rock-demon, where
he now only listens to the echoes of the strokes of his own
pick-axe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;True,&rsquo; said a brawny miner, leaning upon
his spade, &lsquo;<i>I</i> used to be afraid of evil spirits in
these dark holes of ours, and was driven to say my prayers in a
morning before I came to work, to keep them away; but I am grown
wiser now; and, for my part, I will never believe that there is a
devil at all, until I see him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You may see him <span
class="GutSmall">NOW</span>, then!&rsquo; exclaimed a voice from
the lower end of the cave.&nbsp; &lsquo;There are two of
them!&rsquo; cried another; upon which the whole assembly rose in
the utmost terror, and rushed out of the cave, <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>tumbling one
over another into the darkness without, and some not recovering
their feet till they had rolled to the very bottom of the
hill.&nbsp; The stranger was the last to lose his presence of
mind; but even he, it seems, had some latent suspicions that
there might be such a being as the devil, for he soon rushed
after his audience towards the mouth of the cave, and was lost in
the gloom.&nbsp; This absurd termination of the meeting is easily
accounted for.&nbsp; The stone on which Gawen Braithwaite was
standing had been gradually sinking under his weight, and at last
gave way altogether, rolling half way down the upper part of the
cave towards where the audience were assembled.&nbsp; Gawen, of
course, gave way with it, and in his fall dragged me after
him.&nbsp; The sight of two human beings making their entrance
into the cave with such a clatter in a place where no entrance
was known to exist, and the fiendish-looking figures which we had
made ourselves by besmearing our faces with the ruddle and coal,
were too much for the nerves of the valorous audience, who
suspected, from what they heard and saw, that the devil was
really looking after his own; and so they disappeared like magic,
relieving us from the terror which we felt at making so untimely
an entrance into the assembly, as we had reason to expect a by no
means civil reception had we been discovered.&nbsp; Having quite
forgotten the disguised state of our faces, it was not till we
approached the light of their fire that we found out the cause of
their sudden terror; and you can well imagine how we enjoyed the
success of our very involuntary exploit.&nbsp; Yet there was
indeed much to grieve my own heart in what I had learned, for the
first time, that night.&nbsp; My poor sister Martha was, it now
appeared, engaged, probably heart and hand, certainly in her
young affections, to one who was an enemy to <span
class="smcap">God</span> and man, a disbeliever of the truth of
the Gospel, a disturber of the peace of his country!&nbsp; What
course lay before me I knew not.&nbsp; I would not, for my poor
sister&rsquo;s sake, mention the sad truth to my father and
mother; for I well knew that their indignation would know no
bounds, and that they would <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>probably at once expel her from her
home, thus driving her directly into the arms of him, who would
certainly be her ruin, both in body and soul.&nbsp; I shrunk from
mentioning the subject to my sister herself, for I recollected
that I was younger than she, and felt that I had no authority to
control her will, if, after knowing the character of the
stranger, she should still resolve to cling faithfully to his
fortunes.&nbsp; At last, after a sleepless night, and much inward
prayer for light to guide me, I determined to take the course
which I am sure you will say was a wise one&mdash;I resolved to
lay the whole case before my best friend and natural adviser,
Robert Walker.&rdquo;</p>

She is not bred so dull but she can learn;<br />
Happiest of all, is, that her gentle spirit<br />
Commits itself to yours, to be directed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Robert Walker</span> was less
surprised at my history (which it took me a long time to tell)
than I had expected him to be.&nbsp; In fact he knew almost every
thing that was going on in his parish, and people often wondered
how he came to know so intimately matters concerning themselves,
which they had supposed were closely locked up in their own
breasts alone.&nbsp; When I told him of the pestilent doctrines
which the stranger was spreading among the miners and others of
his flock, he immediately reminded me that he had darkly hinted
at this in the sermon which he preached to us before our
confirmation; the substance of which I have just related to
you.&nbsp; I thought he would have split his sides with laughing
when I told him of the way in which Gawen Braithwaite and I had
dispersed the assembly by our sudden and unintentional intrusion
into their councils; and tapping me playfully on the cheek, while
his eyes ran over with tears of mirth, he said, &lsquo;Take care,
my good lad, as long as you live, that you never play the devil
in any other character than you did last night!&nbsp; He is a
<i>kittle</i> customer to deal with, and generally has the best
of it in the end with those who meddle too much with his
concerns.&nbsp; <i>Resist</i> the devil,&rsquo; said he solemnly,
&lsquo;resist the devil and he will flee from
you&mdash;aye,&rsquo; he added, smiling once more at the
recollection, <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>quite as fast as silly <span class="smcap">Willie
Tyson</span> and his man <span
class="smcap">Peter</span>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And so they ran, did they?&rsquo; continued he,
for he could not get the amusing notion out of his head,
&lsquo;<i>very</i> fast, eh?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Like rats out of a burning corn-stack,&rsquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I <i>do</i> wish I had been with you,&rsquo;
said the old man; &lsquo;I would have set up a halloo that would
have rung in Willie&rsquo;s ears till&mdash;till&mdash;till he
gets Coniston Hall!&rsquo; and he laughed once more till his
sides shook again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His mood, however, was soon changed into sober sadness,
when I proceeded to explain to him how the handsome stranger had
won the heart of my poor sister Martha, and how deeply and
unchangeably I feared her affections were engaged.&nbsp; Martha
was a great favourite with Mr. Walker, as indeed she was with
every one who knew her; and he saw at once the difficulty of her
situation.&nbsp; &lsquo;Poor thing!&rsquo; said he, with a deep
expression of melancholy foreboding on his countenance,
&lsquo;what is to become of her!&nbsp; I know her well: she has
not given her heart hastily, nor hastily will she withdraw
it.&nbsp; What a fiend he must be to steal the affections of one
so good, so innocent, and so confiding!&nbsp; Bad men are always
selfish; and with all his professions of zeal for the liberty and
instruction of mankind, he could not forget his own interests, or
restrain his passions.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis always thus; they who
deal with evil on a large scale, are almost sure to indulge in a
little private vice on their own account!&nbsp; Yet why condemn
him hastily?&nbsp; The man that could win the heart of <i>our</i>
Martha must have in him something that is plausible at least, if
not estimable.&nbsp; She would not give away her diamonds for
<span class="smcap">Irton</span> pearls. <a
name="citation78"></a><a href="#footnote78"
class="citation">[78]</a>&nbsp; Who knows but the believing
maiden may be even now converting the unbelieving lover?&nbsp; I
will speak to her on the subject, and that before I am a day
older.&nbsp; I think, my young friend, she will not hesitate to
confess to me her inmost thoughts?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;I will answer for that,&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;but how is the interview to be brought about?&nbsp; I
shrink from entering upon the subject with her myself, and should
be the unwilling bearer of any message which might lead her to
suspect that I had in any way played a false part towards
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Leave that to me,&rsquo; said the old man,
&lsquo;I see no difficulty in the matter.&rsquo;&nbsp; He turned
to his little writing-table, which drew out from beneath his book
shelves, (for we were in his little room on the top of the house
which he had fitted up for his private study,) and wrote as
follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My dear Martha,</p>
<p>I wish to see you tomorrow on particular business, and at
eleven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Bring your brother with you as a
companion by the way.&nbsp; Your affectionate Pastor,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Robert Walker.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This note removed every difficulty at once, as far as I
was concerned.&nbsp; I was thus not supposed to have any
knowledge whatever of the occasion of this summons, but was
merely to be an attendant on my sister&rsquo;s steps.&nbsp; Now,
sir, it is very remarkable, and I have never since been able to
account for it, that though I have generally well remembered (as
you have heard) the state of the sky and weather, and the little
incidents of the journey, on every other occasion that I have
thought of sufficient importance to relate to you, (for such
things always make a deep impression on the mind of a
mountaineer,) yet, on this occasion&mdash;one of the last that I
shall ever forget&mdash;the whole landscape is to me a perfect
blank, and I have not the slightest recollection of any single
event that occurred from the moment when poor Martha and I left
our father&rsquo;s door, to that when we stood before the
parsonage of Seathwaite, and were welcomed by Robert Walker into
his dark and spacious dining-room!&nbsp; <i>That</i> welcome, and
the soft yet somewhat melancholy smile on his countenance, I
shall <i>never</i> forget.&nbsp; As we stood together, looking
out from the long low window on the rich landscape before us, we
saw the <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>handsome stranger cross the little foot-bridge that led
from the other side of the Duddon to the Parsonage, and make his
way directly for the door of the house.&nbsp; Martha, who was the
first to observe him, turned very pale, as if on the point of
fainting, and said in an anxious low voice to Mr. Walker,
&lsquo;I cannot meet him here!&rsquo; and made for the door as if
to escape.&nbsp; The old man laid his hand gently on her arm and
said, &lsquo;You are too late to avoid him, but go behind the
<i>squab</i> if you wish not to be seen; you will be safe enough
there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This squab was a long oaken seat, or settle, with a
high wooden back, running from the fire-place half way down the
middle of the room.&nbsp; I dare say such seats (and very
uncomfortable they are) are still to be found in most of the old
farm-houses in the North.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stranger entered as Martha disappeared; and I was
very much struck with the ease and grace of his manner.&nbsp; He
wore the look and air of one who was on the best possible terms
with himself and all the world.&nbsp; Much as I felt disposed to
dislike him, I could not help admiring both his person and
address.&nbsp; There was an awkwardness and nervous action about
Mr. Walker, which I now observed for the first time, that showed
to great disadvantage when compared with the stranger&rsquo;s
ease and self-possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After courteously placing a seat for his visitor, Mr.
Walker took his accustomed place in his arm-chair in the corner,
and then his wonted calmness and dignity at once returned.&nbsp;
The stranger was the first to break the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, reverend sir,&rsquo; said he, with a bland
smile on his face, &lsquo;I am here at your own request.&nbsp;
How you found out my place of abode I am at some loss to
discover, and what your particular business may be with me, I can
still less conjecture.&nbsp; I shall doubtless learn both at your
convenience.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was nothing in the words of this address to give
the slightest offence; yet there was something in the tone in
which it was uttered, to excite uncomfortable feelings in my
mind, and I saw Mr. Walker slightly <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>colour, as if he felt somewhat
nettled at the manner at least of the address.&nbsp; Yet the
feeling, if such existed, soon passed off; and he resumed his
usual calm yet somewhat firm expression of countenance as he
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The second part of your difficulty, sir, you
have a right to have solved, as it shall soon be; with regard to
the first it seems less to the purpose.&nbsp; I ought in the
first place to say, that it is simply in my public character as
the authorized preacher of the Gospel in this parish, that I have
taken what would otherwise seem a great liberty with a perfect
stranger, to request an interview with him, without first
assigning grounds for the request.&nbsp; That you have so readily
complied with it, I beg to offer you my thanks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was much struck with the somewhat stately form of
language which Mr. Walker in this case assumed&mdash;so different
from his ordinary discourse with his plain country
parishioners.&nbsp; He took up the tone of the scholar and the
gentleman with more ease than I had thought it possible for one
whose course of life had been so long removed from the society of
his equals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said the stranger, &lsquo;before you
proceed further, allow me to protest against your assumption,
that in your public character you have a right to exercise over
me any superintendence or control.&nbsp; I belong not to your
flock, I subscribe not to your creed.&nbsp; Even the tyrannical
Church of Rome professes to fetter the minds and torture the
limbs of those only who have at some period professed allegiance
to her doctrines; and these are not days when the Church of
England can safely arrogate to herself a power (however anxiously
she may long to do so) which would rouse the dormant spirit even
of an Italian slave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pardon me,&rsquo; said Mr. Walker, with the
utmost calmness; &lsquo;over you I neither claim nor wish to
exercise any authority whatever.&nbsp; But there are those over
whose religious condition the laws both of <span
class="smcap">God</span> and man have given me power and
authority, and upon <i>them</i> I am bound to exercise it, both
for their sakes and my own.&nbsp; The Church has devised a
certain system which she <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>declares to be founded on Scripture,
and propounds it to all her people as their rule of faith and
life.&nbsp; I, having given my full assent and consent to that
system, have accepted the office, under her authority, of
spreading and propagating that system among those committed by
her (under the Bishop) to my care.&nbsp; I am not, then, here to
reason out, either with you or my people, a new system, but
simply to enforce one long established by the Church at
large.&nbsp; I am bound by my oath &ldquo;to banish and drive
away all erroneous and strange doctrines,&rdquo; and this by
every means by which the laws of <span class="smcap">God</span>
and man may aid me.&nbsp; While then you are at full liberty, as
far as I am concerned, to entertain any notions you may please as
to religion or politics; you are not, at the same time, equally
at liberty to spread them abroad among my flock, if I can by fair
means prevent it&mdash;and prevent it, by <span
class="smcap">God</span>&rsquo;s blessing, I will!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stranger smiled scornfully at the old man&rsquo;s
energy of expression, and said; &lsquo;My venerable old friend,
attempt not what you cannot accomplish.&nbsp; The day is gone by,
when recluses like you, ignorant of the world and of the strides
which it has of late been making towards full liberty of thought
and action, could keep men&rsquo;s minds in darkness by the vain
terrors of an expiring superstition.&nbsp; Be content to lament
in your chimney corner over the obstinacy of this perverse
generation, and leave the course of events to march on towards
that high destination which assuredly you cannot
hinder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You much mistake the matter,&rsquo; replied Mr.
Walker, &lsquo;if you suppose that we, in these remote regions of
the globe, are necessarily ignorant of the on-goings of the world
beyond our barren mountains.&nbsp; Our books are our telescopes,
which bring distant things distinctly before our observation; and
history tells me the staleness and the vanishing nature of those
theories which to you seem all novelty and permanence.&nbsp; Nor
think that I threaten without power to execute my threats.&nbsp;
I shall not wait to cure the evil which you may occasion; my duty
is to <i>prevent</i>; and that I can do by a power of the extent
of <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>which
you are probably little aware.&nbsp; I thank <span
class="smcap">God</span> it is a moral power, but not, on that
account, the more easy to be resisted.&nbsp; Recollect how long I
have presided over these few sheep in the wilderness, and then
consider whether, by this time, they must not well know the voice
of their master!&nbsp; Why, sir, you could not hide your head in
a cottage between Eskdale Moor and Muncaster Fell, but I, did I
wish it, could know where it rested, and almost what it
meditated, by next morning!&nbsp; Take, then, my advice, and
leave this country for ever.&nbsp; I threaten you with no loss of
life or limb; but if you are found within these bounds after this
solemn warning, your movements will be watched and dogged by
those who have it in their power most effectually to put a stop
to your designs.&nbsp; The mountain top will be no
safeguard&mdash;the gloomy mine no security.&nbsp; Nay, the very
fiends themselves will rise in rebellion at my bidding, and fling
dismay into the hearts of those who rashly deny their
existence!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stranger cast on the old man a look of the utmost
surprise, as he gave utterance to these last words.&nbsp; The
scene in the mine, no doubt, rushed upon his recollection; and he
looked hard at Mr. Walker, as if he wished to trace in his
countenance some signs of his being privy to the ghostly
visitation of the night before.&nbsp; But nothing could be seen
there but the proofs of a mind determined to carry through its
high resolves; and it was with somewhat of a subdued tone that
the stranger at last resumed the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I doubt not,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that you
have it in your power fully to execute your threats.&nbsp; I have
heard and seen enough already to believe it.&nbsp; But why,
sir&mdash;pardon me, I cannot account for it&mdash;why should
<i>you</i> show so much zeal in a cause which seems so little
deserving of your support,&mdash;a Church, which has left merit
like yours to pine in neglect amid these barren mountains; and a
State, which binds you to keep the peace among these
half-civilized barbarians, and does not reward your pains with
even the barren smile of its countenance?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man turned upon the stranger a look in <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>which a
lurking smile was mixed up with much sternness of expression, and
said: &lsquo;Well may I be anxious to remove such a tempter as
you from my unsuspecting flock, when you thus artfully assail
what you doubtless deem the weak side of even the shepherd
himself!&nbsp; My lot indeed may seem to you to be somewhat hard;
but I answer in one word&mdash;a stronger than which the king
himself cannot use&mdash;I <span class="GutSmall">AM
HAPPY</span>.&nbsp; I am where my Master placed me, and that of
itself is enough for a good soldier of <span class="smcap">Jesus
Christ</span>.&nbsp; But, sir, even in a worldly point of view I
am happy, nay, to be envied by those who look with narrow views
(pardon me) like yourself, at what makes happiness here
below.&nbsp; I suppose you think wealth, power, and fame to be
the three things most to be desired to constitute a happy man;
and in which of these am I so deficient, as to give me ground for
repining at the lot which has been assigned me?&nbsp; With regard
to wealth&ndash;though I certainly can boast of none of the
superfluities of life, yet by our own industry and occupation
(without which even abundance cannot give enjoyment) I and my
wife have acquired more of the good things of this life, than
either of us, from the condition of our birth, had a reasonable
right to look for; and who can justly complain, whose lot in life
is better than his father&rsquo;s?&nbsp; As to power&mdash;I
think you have already had abundant proof that I possess it, in
my own sphere of action, in no ordinary degree.&nbsp; What
absolute monarch, or what turbulent populace (and they are much
the same) reigns so uncontrolled as I over the hearts and wills
(but, I am proud to add, <i>through the affections</i>) of the
people of Seathwaite?&nbsp; Power is mine, such as Rome only
dreamt of; the greater because it is never exercised.&nbsp; And
as for fame&mdash;the desire of which is perhaps the least
blameable of our earthly passions, because it springs out of our
innate hope of immortality&mdash;who has it more, in possession
and in prospect, than the old feeble individual before you?&nbsp;
These mountains are visited by tourists attracted by the beauty
and splendour of our rural scenes; but the humble residence of
Robert Walker is not passed by as the least interesting among
them.&nbsp; <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>The Lord of <span class="smcap">Muncaster Castle</span>
doffs that hat to his country pastor, which he would not take off
before his monarch on the throne. <a name="citation85"></a><a
href="#footnote85" class="citation">[85]</a>&nbsp; My
children&mdash;and a fine healthy, though somewhat numerous race
they are&mdash;will hand down my name to the next generation, I
trust, as untarnished as they received it; and my
children&rsquo;s children, unless they are strangely forgetful of
the pious lessons which their fathers have taught them, may hold
it their highest honour to be descended from Robert Walker; and
find that name of itself a passport and a recommendation even in
what is called a cold and heartless world.&nbsp; We have lived
here, sir, my life-companion and I, so long, as almost to form
part of the landscape.&nbsp; Good Bishop Jeremy Taylor tells a
story of an old couple in Ireland, who had resided so long in the
same village that if they had given themselves out to be Adam and
Eve, there was no one alive to contradict then.&nbsp; We are
almost in the same condition.&nbsp; While, then, these rocks
shall frown and that stream shall flow, my name, humble as it may
be, is assured of its earthly immortality.&nbsp; The future Poet,
whom the spirit of the Church and these divine scenes shall
inspire with strains that shall blend the music of earth with the
higher notes of heaven, will not omit my name from his pictures,
when he paints my beloved <span class="smcap">Duddon</span> in
colours which shall last for ever; and who knows but some more
lowly historian, smit with the love of my most humble but sincere
service to my <span class="smcap">Master</span>, shall hold up my
name as a watchword to the fire-side of the quiet cottager; and
teach the farmer at his plough, and the weaver at his loom, to
call to mind my history; recommending to their sons patience, and
perseverance, and piety, by the example (oh, how weak, feeble,
and failing!) of Robert Walker!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man had risen from his chair, and paced the
room with rapid strides as he gave utterance to the last
sentences of this prophetic vision of his future history; and it
was some time before his eye, which was sparkling <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>with pious
gratitude to <span class="smcap">God</span> for all His
blessings, caught that of the stranger, as it was fixed on him
with the expression of a cold and quiet sneer.&nbsp; His
countenance immediately changed, and he coloured slightly at
having thus exposed himself, in his open-heartedness, to the
charge of a vanity, which was surely, in this case, of a most
pardonable nature.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I
have become a fool in glorying&mdash;you have compelled me.&nbsp;
I have shown you that, on your own selfish principles, I have
indeed much to be thankful for.&nbsp; But we must bring this
matter to a close.&nbsp; I look for a promise from you, which you
must see it would be useless to withhold, that you will vex this
quiet district no longer with your presence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I go,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;father; but I go
not alone!&nbsp; You, and this simple youth shall know that there
is at least <i>one</i> heart here which sympathizes with my
feelings, and will not shrink from sharing my fortunes.&nbsp;
Love, father, is stronger than&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I <span class="GutSmall">RENOUNCE
HIM</span>!&rsquo; exclaimed poor Martha, rushing forward from
behind the screen under which she had been sheltered during this
remarkable conversation, and standing erect in the middle of the
room with her eye boldly fixed on the face of the wondering
stranger&mdash;&lsquo;I renounce him, now and for ever!&nbsp; Oh
Frederick!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never forget her expression at that
moment.&nbsp; &lsquo;Father,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;I love
him&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Loved</i> him, you would say, my
child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nay, father, <i>love</i> him still dearly, and
will for ever love him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then fly with me,&rsquo; said the stranger,
&lsquo;to a land less inhospitable than this&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, Frederick! that cannot, <i>shall</i> not
be.&nbsp; At my baptism I was married to Another, and with one
who has stained his baptismal robes will I <i>never</i> be
united!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is some plot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, Frederick, believe it not.&nbsp; All is
honourable, except&mdash;oh, Frederick, why did you not tell me
the truth?&nbsp; Begone; if you can, be happy; but never see me
more!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they parted, and they never did see each other
more!&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The</span> gloom, which had for
some time been lowering darkly round our house, now burst over
our heads with the fury of a thunder-storm.&nbsp; You must often
have observed, sir, that as all the little ailments of a
man&rsquo;s body, which singly are insignificant enough,
gradually combine together, and produce death; so the misfortunes
of life, long kept at a distance, seem at last to come upon an
individual or a family with one united assault, and press it with
irresistible force to the very ground.&nbsp; So it was with
us.&nbsp; My father, habitually silent and reserved, began to
talk more, especially to strangers, and to show a greater
liveliness of manner than we had ever observed in him
before.&nbsp; He spoke about the value of his land, and the
produce of his crops, in a way to make me think that I had a very
comfortable prospect of inheritance before me, and I considered
myself already as one of the established <i>statesmen</i> of the
valley.&nbsp; Alas! how puzzling is poor human nature!&nbsp; At
the very time when my father seemed most to rejoice in his
possessions, he had just come to the conviction that he could no
longer retain them.&nbsp; He had never really felt their value
till they were about to pass away from him and his race for
ever!&nbsp; His <a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>father had been a somewhat expensive man in his habits,
and had mortgaged his little estate to the father of Tom
Hebblethwaite, in the hope, as times were then very good, of
quickly redeeming it.&nbsp; But worse times soon succeeded; and
my poor father and mother, with all their care and industry, were
not able even to pay the interest of the sum borrowed, so that
the debt gradually increased in amount, and the unavoidable issue
was clearly foreseen.&nbsp; This disheartening news my father
took a quiet opportunity of communicating to me, my poor mother
standing by, and the silent tears rolling down her
cheeks&mdash;not for herself, but for her children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My dear lad,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you must
<i>fend</i> for yourself.&nbsp; I have engaged that you shall
become apprentice to an engraver in Manchester, who is a distant
relation of your mother&rsquo;s, and, I am told, in a very
thriving condition.&nbsp; Your mother and I have given you
learning, and we hope, good principles; we had wished to have
given you more, but <span class="smcap">God</span>&rsquo;s will
be done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A change now came over the whole course of my
thoughts.&nbsp; It was like telling me that I was to pass my days
in another world, so little notion had I of anything that was
going on beyond the boundaries of my native mountains; and I
speculated, and wondered, till my mind became confused and
perplexed, and I was unable to attend to even the commonest
concerns of life.&nbsp; I will hasten over this distressing
period, for it is too painful to dwell on, even at this distance
of time.&nbsp; I believe that age magnifies the anxieties that
are far off, as much as it deadens the pain of those that are
near.&nbsp; The recollection to me now, is more grievous than was
the reality at the time.&nbsp; Robert Walker took leave of me
with much sound advice, but with a cheerfulness that removed much
of my horror&mdash;for that was what I felt&mdash;at leaving,
probably for ever, my native hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My good lad,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you are only
about to do what thousands have done before you&mdash;leave these
barren mountains for a scene of usefulness to which you are
evidently called by your heavenly <span
class="smcap">Father</span>.&nbsp; Many of my <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>flock have
gone before you in the same path, and most of them, I thank <span
class="smcap">God</span>, have been highly successful in their
labours.&nbsp; Some of the highest and richest merchants in
Manchester drew their first breath in these humble valleys, and
were taught at my village school.&nbsp; Having here been taught
the lessons of frugality, industry, and attention to religious
duties, they were thus trained for the after-toils of life, and
have become an honour to their country and their Church.&nbsp;
But as for you, I would rather see you good than rich.&nbsp; The
one, with <span class="smcap">God</span>&rsquo;s grace, you can
be; the other may depend on a thousand accidents.&nbsp; I have
prepared a little present for you, which I trust you will always
cherish as proof of my good will.&nbsp; The Bible I know you
have, and its fitting companion and interpreter, the Prayer-book:
here is &lsquo;Nelson&rsquo;s Companion to the Fasts and
Festivals of the Church of England,&rsquo; the best book, next to
the Prayer-book, that the uninspired mind of man ever compiled;
full of learning, full of piety, full of prayer.&nbsp; Know this
book well, and you will be wiser than your teachers; for to
understand and retain in one&rsquo;s mind the contents of one
such book as this, is better than to read whole libraries, and to
have but a dim and misty recollection of them all; and here is
another good book, which you will find a valuable companion to
you in some of your silent and solitary hours&mdash;&lsquo;The
Whole Duty of Man.&rsquo;&nbsp; Blessed be the memory of the
pious lady who wrote it!&nbsp; And may the blessing of <span
class="smcap">God</span> rest for ever on the family which
sheltered the saintly <span class="smcap">Hammond</span> in his
persecutions, and produced her who left to the world this
invaluable legacy! <a name="citation89"></a><a href="#footnote89"
class="citation">[89]</a>&nbsp; In these books you have a
religious library which will meet all your spiritual wants.&nbsp;
Pray for me, as I shall not cease to pray for you&mdash;for
<i>this</i> is the way to remember friends that are far off; and
now go, and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> be with
thee!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I had another parting of a very different kind to
encounter&mdash;with my poor sister <span
class="smcap">Martha</span>.&nbsp; Since her separation from her
lover, she had gone about her daily avocations with her usual,
and even more than her usual <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>cheerfulness and quiet
alacrity.&nbsp; Indeed her eye sparkled with more brilliance, and
her spirits rose to a higher pitch of excitement than I had ever
before observed.&nbsp; She grew perceptibly thinner, but no alarm
was thereby occasioned, as her colour was even heightened in
brightness, and her mind seemed peaceful and happy.&nbsp; Yet I
had watched her with more than common anxiety, and felt much
alarmed for her state, though I could hardly assign the grounds
of my fears.&nbsp; A few days before it was proposed that I
should take my departure, she called me into her room after the
rest of the family had retired to rest, and desired me to sit
down by her side, with a seriousness of manner which seemed to
show that she had some important communication to make.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Brother,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;we part soon;
it may be sooner than you expect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How so?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You must listen to my tale.&nbsp; We have never
talked about <i>him</i> since we parted at Mr.
Walker&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I have never repented what I did
then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, how nobly you acted, dear sister,&rsquo;
said I, &lsquo;and how little you seem to have felt the shock of
such a parting.&nbsp; How I love you for your
determination!&nbsp; You have never seen him since?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I saw him last night!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Indeed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes&mdash;last night.&nbsp; He stood by my
bed-side, looking most pale and ghastly; and reproached me with
deserting him, and leaving him to his fate.&nbsp; He said that I
might have saved him by converting him from his evil ways, but
now on me must rest the consequences of his ruin, both in body
and soul.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It must surely have been a troubled
dream!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, brother, it was a sad reality.&nbsp; I
appeared to myself as wide awake as I am at this moment, and
though my reason tells me that he <i>could</i> not be there, I
saw him with as sober a mind, and an eye as steady as I see you
now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And how do you explain this strange
delusion?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Easily&mdash;I am <span
class="GutSmall">DYING</span>!&nbsp; Look at this hand,&rsquo;
said she, holding up her taper fingers before the candle.&nbsp; I
could distinctly see the flame through the transparent skin, and
trace the blue fret-work of the veins, as though they had been
traced with a lead pencil on a sheet of white paper.&nbsp; I saw
that all was over!</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Brother,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I do not regret
my past conduct in this matter; on the contrary, I rejoice in it
as the only proof of fidelity that I have been permitted to give
to the law of my divine <span class="smcap">Master</span>.&nbsp;
Could I believe that I might have saved him&mdash;but no, I will
not think it possible!&nbsp; I was not to do evil that good might
come.&nbsp; My Bible, Robert Walker, and my own heart approve of
what I have done; and if I die for it, it may be that I shall
live for it (through my <span
class="smcap">Saviour</span>&rsquo;s Blood) hereafter.&nbsp;
Brother, pray for me!&nbsp; I dread the coming night; but I trust
to the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>&rsquo;s power to drive
away from my pillow evil thoughts, and evil spirits.&nbsp; My
mind begins to wander&mdash;I must to prayer.&nbsp; Come to me
early to-morrow morning.&nbsp; Good night, and <span
class="smcap">God</span> bless you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went early according to her request, anxious to hear
her report of the past night, and sincerely praying that it might
have been more peaceful than my own.&nbsp; I stood by her
bed-side, and called her name: all was still.&nbsp; I opened her
window-curtain (bed-curtain there was none) and gazed on her
face.&nbsp; She was dead!&nbsp; Her hands were folded peacefully
on her breast, showing that she had passed away in prayer, and
there was a faint&mdash;a very faint&mdash;smile still lingering
on her lips, as though at the very moment when she closed her
eyes on earth she had just caught a glimpse of heaven.&mdash;Poor
Martha!&rdquo; <a name="citation91"></a><a href="#footnote91"
class="citation">[91]</a></p>
<p>After a pause, the old man proceeded&mdash;&ldquo;I will say
no more of my final parting, because I would avoid my <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>mother&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; Behold me then in <span
class="smcap">Salford</span>!&nbsp; Hard at work from morning
till night, breathing the dense and foggy air of Hanging-ditch,
instead of the pure and invigorating breezes of Tilberthwaite and
Yewdale.&nbsp; Much have I learnt, from sad experience, during my
long life, of the condition of the labouring classes in this busy
hive of men, and much could I tell you of cruelty on the part of
masters, and of ingratitude and improvidence on the part of
men.&nbsp; But I will keep these matters for another
occasion.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, that I believe a manufacturing
state may and <i>will</i> become (though it may be neither in my
time nor yours) quite as happy and as healthy a one as that of
the best-regulated agricultural district.&nbsp; But, sir, the
reformation must begin at the other end&mdash;it must be from the
top first, and then to the bottom!&nbsp; I will tell you a little
secret&mdash;<i>the men</i>, <i>as a body</i>, <i>are quite as
well educated for their station in life</i>, <i>as the
masters</i>, <i>as a body</i>, <i>are for theirs</i>.&nbsp; The
next generation may see masters who have been brought up to the
trade of masters, and not merely men who have become masters by
good fortune; and then may we hope for a thorough reform in the
whole system of conduct of masters and men towards each other; of
which, till then, I almost despair.&nbsp; Meantime, if the Church
had fair play, she would throw her healing branch into the bitter
waters which surround us, and teach mutual love and forbearance
to &lsquo;all sorts and conditions of men.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fully agree with you,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;we have
heard much of late of the want of education among the poor; I
hope we shall hear, soon, of the necessity of a better system of
education among the rich.&nbsp; But, my good old friend, you are
quite forgetting that your tale is about anything else than that
with which it professed to begin, &lsquo;The Old Church
Clock.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right! my dear sir; like many other old men I have
allowed my tongue to out-run my tale.&nbsp; Well, sir, Sunday
came&mdash;a day of joy to me, both as a rest from unusual
labour, and as an opportunity of pouring out my soul <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>in prayer in
the manner that I used to do in my native mountains; so that I
looked to be reminded of my temporal and eternal home, by joining
once more in the same form of worship with my absent parents, and
my good old pastor, Robert Walker.&nbsp; Little do they know of
the beauty of a prescribed form of prayer who have never offered
it up in a distant land!&nbsp; Alas! how were my hopes and
expectations disappointed!&nbsp; I naturally entered the first
place of worship within my reach, expecting it to be, like
Seathwaite chapel, free and open to all comers.&nbsp; But I was
woefully mistaken!&nbsp; A well-cloaked and liveried beadle soon
informed me that there was no room for strangers, and that the
aisle was the only place for me.&nbsp; It was true that I had
this advantage over the sleepers in the well-cushioned pews
around me, that I could kneel in prayer to <span
class="smcap">God</span>, whilst the rest were compelled to sit
in His presence while they asked Him to forgive them their
sins!&nbsp; Still it was most painful to me to worship in
communion with those to whom my joining with them in prayer was
an unwelcome act; and I now felt myself really a solitary amidst
crowds, when, not even in the presence of our common <span
class="smcap">Father</span>, had they any sympathy with their
homeless brother!&nbsp; Well, sir, time passed on; and among my
smaller grievances was the occasionally receiving, and indeed
deserving a reprimand from my over-looker, for having been behind
my time in a morning, at the early hour at which the work of our
establishment commenced.&nbsp; Six was the precise hour; and even
a minute behind that time subjected the truant to a serious
fine.&nbsp; I well remember, one cold wintry morning, looking
anxiously for the first sight of the Old Church Clock, as I
crossed the Salford bridge into Manchester, and saw, to my
horror, that it pointed to exactly five minutes past that
hour.&nbsp; There seemed to my imagination an expression of
strong displeasure in the hard outlines of that old clock&rsquo;s
face, which administered a far stronger rebuke to me than the
violent and unfeeling language which was addressed to me by the
over-looker; and I resolved, if it were possible, not to fall
into the <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>same disgrace again.&nbsp; The next morning I was, by
the same clock, ten minutes before my time.&nbsp; The old clock
seemed to smile at my punctuality, as I do now at the
recollection.&nbsp; How apt is the youthful mind to put a portion
of its own overflowing life even into inanimate things!&nbsp; And
what dead thing is so like a living one as a clock?&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<blockquote><p>We talked with open heart, and tongue<br />
Affectionate and true,<br />
A pair of friends, though I was young,<br />

<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

class="smcap">Wordsworth</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I gradually established an acquaintance with this old
Clock.&nbsp; It had already proved itself a faithful
friend&mdash;indeed the only one that I had yet found in
Manchester; for my mother&rsquo;s distant relation was too much
involved in the all-absorbing pursuit of making money, to have
any room in his thoughts for the wishes and feelings of a poor
country cousin like myself.&nbsp; The Clock, however, had grown
to be so intimate an acquaintance, that I one day took advantage
of a leisure hour to pay it a nearer visit; and was very
attentively looking up into its face from the foot of the tower,
in the space between it and the houses&mdash;which space was then
exceedingly narrow, (the houses are now happily taken down,) when
my shoulders were suddenly assailed by a very smart blow with a
stick, from some person from behind!&nbsp; I turned sharply
round, as might be expected, and saw a little active old man,
dressed in a suit of rusty black, with a hat somewhat of a
clerical shape, and a pair of sharp grey eyes twinkling under
very long and very shaggy eye-brows, in the very act of raising
his cane for the purpose of repeating the salute.&nbsp; I
immediately twisted the offensive weapon out of his grasp, and
seeing the reverend character of the assailant, exclaimed,
&lsquo;<i>Nemo me impune</i>&rsquo;&mdash;flourishing, at the
same time, the cane over his head, as if about to <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>return the
blow.&nbsp; Nothing daunted with my threat, the little man stood
his ground bravely; and said, with a look of mingled fun and
fury, &lsquo;Who beat that bit of Latin into your foolish
head?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;One,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;whose hand was quite
as heavy as yours, though he did not lay on half so hard as you
do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All the worse&mdash;all the worse.&nbsp; Had he
struck harder then, you would have needed it less now!&nbsp; But
why do you stop up the way to church, and stand gazing up to that
tower, as if you were planning to rob the belfry?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I was thinking,&rsquo; said I, for I began to be
more amused than angry with the old man, &lsquo;I was thinking,
when your cane interrupted my meditations, why it was that men
placed clocks in the towers of churches!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That is easily answered, man; to teach you that
time is a sacred thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That is indeed an answer,&rsquo; I replied;
&lsquo;and one worthy of my old friend Mr. Walker of
Seathwaite!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr. Walker!&rsquo; exclaimed the old gentleman,
in great surprise, &lsquo;what knowest thou of Mr. Walker? a very
good man he is, and a very good scholar&mdash;not of the
University, though&mdash;but a good scholar, and an old friend of
mine; what knowest thou of him, man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Know him!&nbsp; Why he is my old pastor and
master&mdash;the best friend I have in all the world!&nbsp; Oh,
sir!&nbsp; If you know him, you must be a good man
too!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dont be too sure of that!&rsquo; said the old
gentleman, somewhat pettishly; &lsquo;there are two opinions on
that subject, I promise you.&nbsp; Which of them <i>I</i> may
entertain, is no concern of yours!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, sir, but I am sure if you are a friend of
Mr. Walker&rsquo;s, you will do me one service for his
sake&mdash;the greatest you ever did to a poor lad in your
life&mdash;you will tell me where I may go to church on
Sundays.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;His cane, which I had restored to him, dropped
to the ground, and he held up his hands in mute
astonishment.&nbsp; &lsquo;The lad&rsquo;s lost his wits,&rsquo;
he said, as if to himself&mdash;&lsquo;<i>clean gyte</i>, as his
old friend Robert Walker would <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>say!&nbsp; There he is, standing
before a church door wide open to receive him, and high enough
for even his long legs to stride under, and he coolly asks me
where he may go to church on Sundays!&nbsp; Why, man,
<i>there</i> you may go to church, not only on Sundays, but every
day in the week&mdash;and the oftener the better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was odd that this had never struck me before; but I
had fancied, I suppose from its size and beauty, that this was a
church intended, like those I had already tried, only for the
accommodation of the rich; and I said so to him whom I was
addressing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old gentleman smiled at my simplicity, but there
was more expression of kindness in his countenance than I had
hitherto observed.&nbsp; &lsquo;The rich,&rsquo;&mdash;said he,
with a tone of contempt, &lsquo;why, man, that is the <span
class="smcap">Parish Church</span>, free to all alike, rich and
poor, good and bad.&nbsp; The poor are by far the greater number,
and, between ourselves, rather the better behaved and more
attentive class, of the two.&nbsp; The rich take liberties with
me sometimes, which the poor <i>dare</i> not&mdash;if they did, I
would break every bone in their skin!&nbsp; But,&rsquo; said he
in a lower tone, &lsquo;I dont think any of them wish me much
ill, after all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, taking me by the hand, he said, &lsquo;And so, my
poor lad, you feared to come into this church because you thought
it was the church only of the rich man!&nbsp; Come along with me,
and I will soon provide you with a sitting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He dragged me with a rapid step through the
church-door, and up the middle aisle, till he came to a place
which he doubtless knew to be at that time unoccupied; and
setting me down with great force in one corner of a bench, he
said, &lsquo;There! sit there!&nbsp; That is your seat as long as
you occupy it punctually.&nbsp; If any one shall disturb you, say
that old Rivers, the Reverend Joseph Rivers, placed you there;
and I should like to see the man that dares disturb you after
that!&rsquo; and he flourished his cane with an emphasis which
seemed to show that <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>the consequences of so rash an act would indeed be
serious!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such, sir, was my introduction to the Parish Church,
and such is the favour&mdash;the inestimable blessing&mdash;which
I owe to the Old Church Clock!&nbsp; How often have I wished that
the same blessing could be extended to the multitudes of young
men that pour annually from the country into this great
metropolis of manufactures and commerce, even if it were
accompanied with the sharp discipline of old Mr. Rivers&rsquo;
cane, which I experienced!&nbsp; Sir, thousands are
lost&mdash;lost for ever&mdash;from the want which I felt, and
from which the Old Clock delivered me&mdash;want of
church-room!&nbsp; It gives them first the plea to spend the
Sunday in idleness; and a Sunday so spent is but a preface to one
of vice and dissipation.&nbsp; Would that there were a dozen Old
Churches in this vast hive of human beings!&nbsp; Well, sir, that
seat I have occupied from that day to the present hour&mdash;full
five-and-forty years!&nbsp; They have been years of trial, and
sometimes of trouble to me; but I have always found my best
consolation <i>there</i>.&nbsp; During my days of toil and labour
I was never absent from the Sunday services; and now that a
moderate competency and the advance of years give me grounds for
retirement from busy life, the daily services find me a constant
and delighted attendant.&nbsp; I find the daily temple worship
the best possible preparation for that service which I trust may
soon be my occupation in a higher sphere; the best soother of the
passions; the surest relief in sorrow.&nbsp; Within those walls I
have escaped all those anxieties which spring from religious
doubts and differences, and have said the same prayers, and
listened to the same doctrines during the lapse of half a
century.&nbsp; The daily service flows on, in my ears, like my
native <span class="smcap">Duddon</span>&mdash;always the same,
yet ever fresh and new.&nbsp; I have seen sects rise and fall,
and various forms of dissent flourish and decay; but they have no
more moved my mind than the fleeting lights and shadows, sunbeams
and storms, which pass successively over that venerable fabric,
<a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>can
disturb its foundations, or even shake one pinnacle from its
towers.&nbsp; In those free sittings, so well thronged by pious
worshippers, what changes have I lived to behold!&nbsp; I have
seen the grey head of many a faithful soldier of <span
class="smcap">Christ</span> laid low, while its place in the
ranks has instantly been filled up by one as zealous and almost
as grey as that which has been removed.&nbsp; Nay, the shepherds
of the flock have been smitten as well as the sheep.&nbsp; I
followed to the grave my old friend Mr. Joseph Rivers, to whose
blunt kindness, and friendship for my master Robert Walker, I was
so deeply indebted; and much was I gratified to see the flood of
tears that was shed by the poor over the old man&rsquo;s
grave!&nbsp; It was a proof to me that men know how to value
honesty and integrity, even though it be clouded, as it sometimes
is, by a hasty manner and a rough outside.&nbsp; And I have
followed to the grave one to whom I looked up with a feeling of
deeper reverence and gratitude&mdash;the pious
Christian&mdash;the courteous gentleman&mdash;the late venerable
Head of our Church in this place.&nbsp; He was to me not only a
teacher, but, I may almost venture to say, a companion and
friend.&nbsp; How often have I hoped and prayed that he might be
permitted to out-strip me in length of days as far as he did in
his Christian walk!&nbsp; But it was not so ordained!&nbsp; Truly
may I say of him, in the words of Scripture, &lsquo;That other
disciple did out-run Peter,&mdash;and I came first to the
sepulchre!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The silent tears rolled down the old man&rsquo;s cheek as he
paused for a moment to meditate on the tomb of his pastor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My tale,&rdquo; he soon added, &ldquo;is now at an
end.&nbsp; It is probably, as I said, but of little interest to
any one but myself, and you who have so kindly listened to
it.&nbsp; Yet I shall not have told it to you in vain, if it lead
you to recollect that the poorest man you meet has his little
history, could he be induced to tell it; and his deep interest in
the Church, could he be led to think so.&nbsp; At all
events,&rdquo; he concluded, with a smile, &ldquo;you will not, I
am <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>sure,
now blame me much, should you meet the Old Man once more on the
Victoria-bridge, on a Saturday night, and find him setting his
watch by&mdash;(even should it be a few minutes too
slow)&mdash;<span class="smcap">the Old Church
Clock</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>FOOTNOTES.</h2>
<p><a name="footnotevii"></a><a href="#citationvii"
class="footnote">[vii]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be very
interesting to trace the precise period when the late culpable
neglect of Church discipline (more especially in observing the
duty of daily prayer in churches) began to be generally
prevalent.&nbsp; It would seem to be soon after, and not before,
the year 1720.&nbsp; The author has now lying before him a daily
journal kept by a collateral ancestor, who was curate of Garstang
Church-Town, an agricultural district of this county, in the
years 1723&ndash;4&ndash;5, from which it appears that, even in
that retired district, prayers were then said in the church on
all Wednesdays and Fridays, and all Saints&rsquo; days and
Holydays throughout the year.&nbsp; The labour of a curate then,
(for the vicar was non-resident,) was such as is seldom surpassed
even by the often almost intolerable toils of the present
day.&nbsp; The following is a specimen of the journal referred
to:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">April</span>, 1723.</p>
<p>&ldquo;12.&nbsp; <i>Good Friday</i>.&nbsp; Read prayers, Mr.
Hayward [the vicar] preached, and we administered the sacrament
to 236 communicants.&nbsp; After dinner I went into Claughton
[two miles off] to visit the sick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;13.&nbsp; Mr. Hayward read prayers; I went into the
parish, and administered the sacrament at three private houses to
sick and aged people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;14.&nbsp; <i>Easter Day</i>.&nbsp; I read
prayers.&nbsp; Mr. Hayward preached; and we administered the
sacrament to 285 communicants.&nbsp; Afternoon: Mr. Hayward read
prayers, and I preached; and then went to visit a sick
child.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reader will be struck with the large attendance at the
communion.&nbsp; We have had sad fallings-off since the year
1723!</p>
<p>I cannot resist making one or two other extracts, showing the
general character of this curious little journal of the Rev.
Thomas Parkinson:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">February</span>, 1722.</p>
<p>&ldquo;1.&nbsp; Went to Street to visit Mrs. Salome, and
administered the sacrament to her.&nbsp; She is 103 years old,
yet very perfect in memory, sight, and hearing to admiration.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">April</span>, 1723.</p>
<p>&ldquo;30.&nbsp; Studied hard yesterday in the afternoon and
this morning, and finished the 103rd sermon.&nbsp; At night I
preached it for T. Raby, of Tarnaker, at St.
Michael&rsquo;s.&nbsp; His son paid me 10s.&nbsp; Mr.
Crombleholm, the vicar there, came from London whilst I was
there, who, in conjunction with three more, had bought Rawcliff
Demain and Tenants, paying to the Board &pound;11,260.&nbsp; It
cost them near &pound;1000 more in hush-money, as they call
it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">October</span>, 1723.</p>
<p>&ldquo;18.&nbsp; In the morning I went to visit William
Grayston, who seemed very penitent after an ill-spent life.&nbsp;
I pray <span class="smcap">God</span> forgive him.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">October</span>, 1723.</p>
<p>&ldquo;28.&nbsp; In the morning I went to see W. Grayston, who
had been perverted by a Romish priest in his sickness, but, by
the blessing of <span class="smcap">God</span>, I restored him to
the Church, and administered the communion to him after he had
begged pardon.&nbsp; He gave me then &pound;1. 18s. 6d. to
distribute, in way of restitution, to some he had unjustly
injured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nov. 2.&nbsp; Studied all the morning, and finished the
110th.&nbsp; Afternoon: I went to see W. Grayston and old Mrs.
Salome.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; I ought to add that the number of attendants at the
communion, above stated, was by no means unusual; for besides the
communicants being, on ordinary Sundays, at least one hundred, I
find the following entries in his next year&rsquo;s
Diary:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">April</span>, 1724.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3.&nbsp; <i>Good Friday</i>.&nbsp; I preached.&nbsp;
Mr. Hayward, [who seems always to have attended on these
occasions,] read prayers, and consecrated.&nbsp; We had a vast
number of communicants, more than have been usually seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;4.&nbsp; Mr. Hayward read prayers.&nbsp; I went into
the parish to visit sick and impotent people; that is, such as
cou&rsquo;d not come to church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;5.&nbsp; <i>Easter-day</i>.&nbsp; I preached in the
forenoon.&nbsp; Mr. Hayward read prayers, and consecrated.&nbsp;
We had a great many communicants at those three days of
sacrament.&nbsp; [Palm Sunday was one.]&nbsp; At church we had
about 656 communicants, and I administered to about 60 impotent
people in the parish.&nbsp; I read prayers afternoon, and Mr.
Hayward preached.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="footnotexii"></a><a href="#citationxii"
class="footnote">[xii]</a>&nbsp; The following is Mr.
Newton&rsquo;s own account of the state of his late parish in the
hands of his successor, and that successor such a man as Mr.
Scott.&nbsp; The narrative is a melancholy one.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I was very cordially received at Olney; the
heats and animosities which prevailed when I was there last,
seemed in a great measure subsided.&nbsp; There are, however,
many who have left the Church, and hear among the Dissenters; but
I hope they have not left the <span
class="smcap">Lord</span>.&nbsp; Mr. Scott has some, and some of
the best, who are affectionately attached to him.&nbsp; Mr. Scott
is a good and upright man, and a good preacher, but different
ministers have different ways.&nbsp; He met with great
prejudices, and some very improper treatment, upon his first
coming to Olney.&nbsp; He found several professors who had more
leaves than fruit, more talk than grace; his spirit was rather
hurt by what he saw amiss, and by what he felt.&nbsp; By what I
can learn from those who love him best, he is very favourable and
zealous in reproving what is wrong; but an unfavourable
impression he has received, that the people at large do not like
him, gives a sort of edge to his preaching which is not so well
suited to conciliate them.&nbsp; The best of the Olney people are
an afflicted people, and have been led through great inward
conflicts and spiritual distresses, and for want of some
experience of the like kind, he cannot so well hit their

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
